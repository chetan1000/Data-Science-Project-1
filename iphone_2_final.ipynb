       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2    Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India  \n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India  \n",

Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

I bought an iphone 7 specifically because of the button when I broke my old 6S.Since the day I bought this phone, it had been showing battery drain and overheating. I thought it would be due to the intense icloud downloads that the phone was doing in the background. Ever since day 1, the phone wouldn't receive calls or can make calls. I thought it would be a network issue.I tried doing a return after 2 days noticing the phone's not showing any signs of proper useability without a charger at hand at all times. But Amazon would not allow me to return it saying contact Apple support. Now apple support was on Holidays till 3rd of January.Finally when I got to Apple support, they have done a diagnostic and couldn't find anything unusual, but asked me to observe for 3 more days. 3 more days, I contacted Apple for them to tell me to take it to a service center. Still cannot make phone calls or receive them. I tried returning through multiple different options, which all led me back to amazon responding saying contact apple support. I went to the Vodafone store to confirm if I had any network issues, only for them to find out, no matter which sim they put in my phone, it will not make or receive phone calls.So I went to the service centre for them to keep my phone under observation for another 5 days. And they acknowledged the phone's showing temperature and battery drain, but since Apple diagnosis isn't showing any issues, they asked me to continue using the phone for another 1-2 weeks.Now, as they did restore the phone, I tried coming back home with my sim card, only to see, the same issue, that I cannot make phone calls or receive them. I can send/receive text messages. I contacted Apple support again, for them to acknowledge now that there is an issue and I have to send it for service.Now as the return period is conveniently over, Amazon refuses to do anything to take the faulty product back. I have wasted 2 weeks of time and energy running around trying to get this phone fixed, only to waste another week or two for the phone to go out and get repaired and come back.Amazon has responded asking me to get a \"service denied letter\" from Apple support for them to refund and take return of this product that I have wasted 2 weeks on.So, long story short, go buy it from a local store. You buy it from Amazon, be prepared to chase tails and run around like headless chicken to sort out any issue you're facing. Worse, if you're in a place with no local authorised apple service centre.</td>\n",

However I was not able to get the WhatsApp backup from Android to iPhone. Reading some tutorials made me understand that it is better to lose the chats to spend hours on the procedure.No launcher like Android (Probably iPhone users are used with it).• The fingerprint sensor is not as fast and responsive as my Google Pixel 2 XL.• The camera clarity is good. I would not say it is better or best, just good.• Water resistant phone is a relief point.• Call clarity and earphones clarity are good.• Only earphones with lightning interface can be connected, forget your traditional 3.5mm earphones. No adapters are given with the phone, may be you can get one from the market, I believe.• Battery back, charging time are good.• A big relief point is many Google apps such as Google Photos, Google Play Music are available for iPhone, therefore no pain of synchronizing music and photos.Apple fans may argue the price is because it's Apple's phone, okay, but many Android phones with higher specifications are available for this or even lesser price range.

Indian(Bangalore Numbers there is no response).Another time call connected to Australian  call center (Per minute Rs.30 charge.)before reaching executive the call was disconnected with huge BIll.Finally I placed a call back request to apple customer care.an executive called from Singapore Center and convinced me with a message \"in this COVID 19 days we may not support you at service centers@Chennai\".. He guided me to send some analytics (reports) forward to him and to my surprise he confirmed there is no issue in the phone.!!!!!!He sent few basic FAQs on Iphone 7 Battery optimization which is not all all useful for my issue.Now the sad part is i am carrying my phone with charger mostly 4 to 5 charges per day for very minimal calls/Whatsup usage.The worst part is... even though in standby mode also the battery was draining fast.Finally i need to check in Airplane Mode before pack into my box.I strongly believe Iphone 7 had some bugs with battery management.</td>\n",

       "2     Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "12    Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Value for money not provided by Amazon for iPhone 7.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "22    Coming from oneplus 3, this phone has been a great upgrade. Always wanted to know why the iOS is so popular. Well it is because it never disappoints. I am writing this review one year after purchasing it and it works like a charm. Still. I don’t feel the need to upgrade to some other device (iphone 8, x or xs) because it works flawlessly without any lag or delay whatsoever. The camera is great.The only problem is the battery life which isn’t enough for a complete day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "23    I got the delivery of this phone on December 30th. I bought an iphone 7 specifically because of the button when I broke my old 6S.Since the day I bought this phone, it had been showing battery drain and overheating. I thought it would be due to the intense icloud downloads that the phone was doing in the background. Ever since day 1, the phone wouldn't receive calls or can make calls. I thought it would be a network issue.I tried doing a return after 2 days noticing the phone's not showing any signs of proper useability without a charger at hand at all times. But Amazon would not allow me to return it saying contact Apple support. Now apple support was on Holidays till 3rd of January.Finally when I got to Apple support, they have done a diagnostic and couldn't find anything unusual, but asked me to observe for 3 more days. 3 more days, I contacted Apple for them to tell me to take it to a service center. Still cannot make phone calls or receive them. I tried returning through multiple different options, which all led me back to amazon responding saying contact apple support. I went to the Vodafone store to confirm if I had any network issues, only for them to find out, no matter which sim they put in my phone, it will not make or receive phone calls.So I went to the service centre for them to keep my phone under observation for another 5 days. And they acknowledged the phone's showing temperature and battery drain, but since Apple diagnosis isn't showing any issues, they asked me to continue using the phone for another 1-2 weeks.Now, as they did restore the phone, I tried coming back home with my sim card, only to see, the same issue, that I cannot make phone calls or receive them. I can send/receive text messages. I contacted Apple support again, for them to acknowledge now that there is an issue and I have to send it for service.Now as the return period is conveniently over, Amazon refuses to do anything to take the faulty product back. I have wasted 2 weeks of time and energy running around trying to get this phone fixed, only to waste another week or two for the phone to go out and get repaired and come back.Amazon has responded asking me to get a \"service denied letter\" from Apple support for them to refund and take return of this product that I have wasted 2 weeks on.So, long story short, go buy it from a local store. You buy it from Amazon, be prepared to chase tails and run around like headless chicken to sort out any issue you're facing. Worse, if you're in a place with no local authorised apple service centre.   \n",

       "27    This is my first ever iPhone. To be honest, it was really tougher for me initially to understand things on an iPhone when you're used with Android phones for several years. The first problem I faced is when I want all my contacts from Android phones to to my iPhone. Fortunately some app in the app store helped me copying the contacts from my Google account to iPhone. However I was not able to get the WhatsApp backup from Android to iPhone. Reading some tutorials made me understand that it is better to lose the chats to spend hours on the procedure.No launcher like Android (Probably iPhone users are used with it).• The fingerprint sensor is not as fast and responsive as my Google Pixel 2 XL.• The camera clarity is good. I would not say it is better or best, just good.• Water resistant phone is a relief point.• Call clarity and earphones clarity are good.• Only earphones with lightning interface can be connected, forget your traditional 3.5mm earphones. No adapters are given with the phone, may be you can get one from the market, I believe.• Battery back, charging time are good.• A big relief point is many Google apps such as Google Photos, Google Play Music are available for iPhone, therefore no pain of synchronizing music and photos.Apple fans may argue the price is because it's Apple's phone, okay, but many Android phones with higher specifications are available for this or even lesser price range. If you come from Android platform to iPhone, this might be little disappointing, gives you pain and make you feel cluttered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "29    I have been using it since the last 2 days and have noticed some heating issues .. We have 2 other iPhone 7’s but none of them heat up like this one .. Usually heats up when I’m on an application or charging .

       "30    Being an Apple customer enjoying IPOD & MAC...This time i took a decision to buy my 1st Apple Phone..But i am totally disappointed with a Poor battery Performance!!!Eventhough it is  not competing with my three years old samsung phone.After 1st week Audio volume for phone calls are pretty low which was not at all audible unless in speakerphone or ear phone.Feeling lot of heat while in calls. Battery draining like rocket. In Hotspot sharing the battery level is draining too fast. I have tried factory reset, software update, Background apps pause, power save mode, mobile data off...but there is no improvement in the battery performance.Finally on the 10th day decided to return back the product to amazon. Unfortunately  options are not allowed/ and the radio buttons not allowed me to place the request.tried to reach customer care but failed to reach them.As a lost resort tired to reach apple customer care. Indian(Bangalore Numbers there is no response).Another time call connected to Australian  call center (Per minute Rs.30 charge.)before reaching executive the call was disconnected with huge BIll.Finally I placed a call back request to apple customer care.an executive called from Singapore Center and convinced me with a message \"in this COVID 19 days we may not support you at service centers@Chennai\".. He guided me to send some analytics (reports) forward to him and to my surprise he confirmed there is no issue in the phone.!!!!!!He sent few basic FAQs on Iphone 7 Battery optimization which is not all all useful for my issue.Now the sad part is i am carrying my phone with charger mostly 4 to 5 charges per day for very minimal calls/Whatsup usage.The worst part is... even though in standby mode also the battery was draining fast.Finally i need to check in Airplane Mode before pack into my box.I strongly believe Iphone 7 had some bugs with battery management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "34    I ordered the 32 GB iPhone 7 via Amazon. The phone arrived on time and well packed. The phone was absolutely new and the manufacturing date was as recent asOctober 2018 itself.  The phone is definitely an excellent upgrade over the iPhone 6 and 6s. It comes pre loaded with iOS 12.0.1 and is extremely fast and zippy. The built of the phone is superb and it feels extremely premium. The camera is amazing and the sound quality is loud with a clear output. Overall an excellent phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "37    I’m giving one star due to its poor performance in data connectivity. The internet connectivity is very bad. My iPhone 5s was far far better as compared to iPhone 7 performance in terms of connectivity. It has been 36 days since I bought this phone and I already feeling like throwing this phone n go for some android phone. I had a good conversation with the apple support n he also could not figure out the issue n asked me to go to a apple store n get it checked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "38    From the time I bought the iPhone 7, it shut off, then went dead. Dud a soft restart & a hard reset. Still does not work. Amazon will not accept it back. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON.

       "2         Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India\n",

Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has.

Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India  \n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India  \n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       redmi phones cameras are great of course iphone is better but is the 6 more redmi phones that i can get for 1 iphone justifiable for such a difference in price well absolutely yesiphone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a alto with bmw yes both have 4 wheels both have ac both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differencethe high price of iphone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has sure it is just 12 mp but the clarity my o mysure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a redmi but it lasts longer than a redmii know i am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people i was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iphonei have been using a macbook for 10 years and since my work depends on it i need it but a phone why it is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and i have my slr for photographybut i was so wrong an iphone is an iphone once you use it there is no turning backmy last iphone was a 4s and then since i love buying phones every 6 months i shifted to android redmi samsung honor to satiate my hunger for new phones all these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iphone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iphone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraand features like airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iphone and macbookbottom line iphone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar the x is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iphone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in india  \n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       redmi phones cameras are great of course iphone is better but is the 6 more redmi phones that i can get for 1 iphone justifiable for such a difference in price well absolutely yesiphone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a alto with bmw yes both have 4 wheels both have ac both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differencethe high price of iphone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has sure it is just 12 mp but the clarity my o mysure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a redmi but it lasts longer than a redmii know i am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people i was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iphonei have been using a macbook for 10 years and since my work depends on it i need it but a phone why it is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and i have my slr for photographybut i was so wrong an iphone is an iphone once you use it there is no turning backmy last iphone was a 4s and then since i love buying phones every 6 months i shifted to android redmi samsung honor to satiate my hunger for new phones all these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iphone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iphone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraand features like airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iphone and macbookbottom line iphone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar the x is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iphone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in india   \n",

       "      <td>Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India</td>\n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       redmi phones cameras are great of course iphone is better but is the 6 more redmi phones that i can get for 1 iphone justifiable for such a difference in price well absolutely yesiphone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a alto with bmw yes both have 4 wheels both have ac both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differencethe high price of iphone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has sure it is just 12 mp but the clarity my o mysure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a redmi but it lasts longer than a redmii know i am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people i was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iphonei have been using a macbook for 10 years and since my work depends on it i need it but a phone why it is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and i have my slr for photographybut i was so wrong an iphone is an iphone once you use it there is no turning backmy last iphone was a 4s and then since i love buying phones every 6 months i shifted to android redmi samsung honor to satiate my hunger for new phones all these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iphone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iphone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraand features like airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iphone and macbookbottom line iphone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar the x is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iphone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in india   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       Redmi phones cameras are great of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price Well absolutely yesiPhone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW yes both have 4 wheels both have AC both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differenceThe high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has Sure it is just 12 MP but the clarity my o mySure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi but it lasts longer than a RedmiI know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people I was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhoneI have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it I need it but a phone Why It is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and I have my SLR for photographyBut I was so wrong an iPhone is an iPhone Once you use it there is no turning backMy last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months I shifted to Android Redmi Samsung Honor to satiate my hunger for new phones All these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iPhone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraAnd features like Airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iPhone and MacbookBottom line iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar The X is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India   \n",

       "2       redmi phones cameras are great of course iphone is better but is the 6 more redmi phones that i can get for 1 iphone justifiable for such a difference in price well absolutely yesiphone camera is not just better it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a alto with bmw yes both have 4 wheels both have ac both can run at 100 kmph but you know the differencethe high price of iphone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has sure it is just 12 mp but the clarity my o mysure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a redmi but it lasts longer than a redmii know i am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one but there are so many people i was one of them who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iphonei have been using a macbook for 10 years and since my work depends on it i need it but a phone why it is not a necessity like the laptop it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally and i have my slr for photographybut i was so wrong an iphone is an iphone once you use it there is no turning backmy last iphone was a 4s and then since i love buying phones every 6 months i shifted to android redmi samsung honor to satiate my hunger for new phones all these phones are superb no doubt but once you use the iphone 7 you know that the difference between these phones and iphone 6s has got much bigger because of the cameraand features like airdrop 100 pics transferred from the phone to macbook within 45 seconds are so good if you are using both iphone and macbookbottom line iphone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar the x is double the price of a 7 so probably all things taken in account the iphone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in india   \n",
