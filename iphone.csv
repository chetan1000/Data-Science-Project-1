2,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India",Great phone...

19,mohammad n.,23 January 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This iPhone7 is in hearing problems. What Can I do,
20,Keshav Singh,18 October 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Exactly after one year 1 week the ear piece ddnt work. when i went to the store they asked me 35k for replacement. useless phones. for the premium price tag of 55-60K the phones dont even work for 1 year. I had 5s, 6 Plus and this 7. All had same type of problems and the phone went into trouble exactly after warranty.Useless.These big companies take india and indians for a ride.I would never buy any apple products for sure.",
21,Vikram Nayak ,13 May 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life of my device is minimal. Drains so fast. In 4 days of usage, battery health reduced to 98%. I am using iPhone for last 4-5 years. But this product delivered was astonishing. Value for money not provided by Amazon for iPhone 7.",
22,Sunil Bhawariya,26 August 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Coming from oneplus 3, this phone has been a great upgrade. Always wanted to know why the iOS is so popular. Well it is because it never disappoints. I am writing this review one year after purchasing it and it works like a charm. Still. I don’t feel the need to upgrade to some other device (iphone 8, x or xs) because it works flawlessly without any lag or delay whatsoever. The camera is great.The only problem is the battery life which isn’t enough for a complete day.",
23,Lalit A.,10 October 2017,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got the delivery of this phone on December 30th. I bought an iphone 7 specifically because of the button when I broke my old 6S.Since the day I bought this phone, it had been showing battery drain and overheating. I thought it would be due to the intense icloud downloads that the phone was doing in the background. Ever since day 1, the phone wouldn't receive calls or can make calls. I thought it would be a network issue.I tried doing a return after 2 days noticing the phone's not showing any signs of proper useability without a charger at hand at all times. But Amazon would not allow me to return it saying contact Apple support. Now apple support was on Holidays till 3rd of January.Finally when I got to Apple support, they have done a diagnostic and couldn't find anything unusual, but asked me to observe for 3 more days. 3 more days, I contacted Apple for them to tell me to take it to a service center. Still cannot make phone calls or receive them. I tried returning through multiple different options, which all led me back to amazon responding saying contact apple support. I went to the Vodafone store to confirm if I had any network issues, only for them to find out, no matter which sim they put in my phone, it will not make or receive phone calls.So I went to the service centre for them to keep my phone under observation for another 5 days. And they acknowledged the phone's showing temperature and battery drain, but since Apple diagnosis isn't showing any issues, they asked me to continue using the phone for another 1-2 weeks.Now, as they did restore the phone, I tried coming back home with my sim card, only to see, the same issue, that I cannot make phone calls or receive them. I can send/receive text messages. I contacted Apple support again, for them to acknowledge now that there is an issue and I have to send it for service.Now as the return period is conveniently over, Amazon refuses to do anything to take the faulty product back. I have wasted 2 weeks of time and energy running around trying to get this phone fixed, only to waste another week or two for the phone to go out and get repaired and come back.Amazon has responded asking me to get a ""service denied letter"" from Apple support for them to refund and take return of this product that I have wasted 2 weeks on.So, long story short, go buy it from a local store. You buy it from Amazon, be prepared to chase tails and run around like headless chicken to sort out any issue you're facing. Worse, if you're in a place with no local authorised apple service centre.",

   Packet was totally damaged & ph is in dead condition, also there is no seal on the box , attached video for your reference",
25,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Over all phone is very good except it’s  battery. If you are a full time internet user don’t buy this phone. Battery life maximum 8 hours if you using full time internet.,
26,J Balaji,6 March 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,  battery life is bad... also now ios system files take up 15 gb so approx 15gb left for files storage... becomes very less... apple should give users 32 gb useable space as they are charging us for it.,
27,Ahsan,3 September 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first ever iPhone. To be honest, it was really tougher for me initially to understand things on an iPhone when you're used with Android phones for several years. The first problem I faced is when I want all my contacts from Android phones to to my iPhone. Fortunately some app in the app store helped me copying the contacts from my Google account to iPhone. However I was not able to get the WhatsApp backup from Android to iPhone. Reading some tutorials made me understand that it is better to lose the chats to spend hours on the procedure.No launcher like Android (Probably iPhone users are used with it).• The fingerprint sensor is not as fast and responsive as my Google Pixel 2 XL.• The camera clarity is good. I would not say it is better or best, just good.• Water resistant phone is a relief point.• Call clarity and earphones clarity are good.• Only earphones with lightning interface can be connected, forget your traditional 3.5mm earphones. No adapters are given with the phone, may be you can get one from the market, I believe.• Battery back, charging time are good.• A big relief point is many Google apps such as Google Photos, Google Play Music are available for iPhone, therefore no pain of synchronizing music and photos.Apple fans may argue the price is because it's Apple's phone, okay, but many Android phones with higher specifications are available for this or even lesser price range. If you come from Android platform to iPhone, this might be little disappointing, gives you pain and make you feel cluttered.",
28,Mandeep B.,4 October 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Poor product, I want to replace this product , Battery back up is not at all good, decreasing every 2-3min, I recently had iphone 6s and it wasn't the same. On stand by it decresed 20% last night",
29,Akhil Jude,12 January 2021,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using it since the last 2 days and have noticed some heating issues .. We have 2 other iPhone 7’s but none of them heat up like this one .. Usually heats up when I’m on an application or charging . Will definitely return the product .Really disappointed,
30,ranjeet,17 October 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Being an Apple customer enjoying IPOD & MAC...This time i took a decision to buy my 1st Apple Phone..But i am totally disappointed with a Poor battery Performance!!!Eventhough it is  not competing with my three years old samsung phone.After 1st week Audio volume for phone calls are pretty low which was not at all audible unless in speakerphone or ear phone.Feeling lot of heat while in calls. Battery draining like rocket. In Hotspot sharing the battery level is draining too fast. I have tried factory reset, software update, Background apps pause, power save mode, mobile data off...but there is no improvement in the battery performance.Finally on the 10th day decided to return back the product to amazon. Unfortunately  options are not allowed/ and the radio buttons not allowed me to place the request.tried to reach customer care but failed to reach them.As a lost resort tired to reach apple customer care. Indian(Bangalore Numbers there is no response).Another time call connected to Australian  call center (Per minute Rs.30 charge.)before reaching executive the call was disconnected with huge BIll.Finally I placed a call back request to apple customer care.an executive called from Singapore Center and convinced me with a message ""in this COVID 19 days we may not support you at service centers@Chennai"".. He guided me to send some analytics (reports) forward to him and to my surprise he confirmed there is no issue in the phone.!!!!!!He sent few basic FAQs on Iphone 7 Battery optimization which is not all all useful for my issue.Now the sad part is i am carrying my phone with charger mostly 4 to 5 charges per day for very minimal calls/Whatsup usage.The worst part is... even though in standby mode also the battery was draining fast.Finally i need to check in Airplane Mode before pack into my box.I strongly believe Iphone 7 had some bugs with battery management.",

33,Sarvap Praharanayuthan,18 May 2019,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery issue. Lasts only 8 hrs. Apple and Amazon website declares 13 hrs of LTE usage. But Apple service centre rejected it and said 8 hrs is the normal life of an iPhone. You have to charge 3 times in a day.Irritating.Amazon have no return policy for the device complaint. You have to approach Apple care only.,
34,Sadiq Brown,10 February 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I ordered the 32 GB iPhone 7 via Amazon. The phone arrived on time and well packed. The phone was absolutely new and the manufacturing date was as recent asOctober 2018 itself.  The phone is definitely an excellent upgrade over the iPhone 6 and 6s. It comes pre loaded with iOS 12.0.1 and is extremely fast and zippy. The built of the phone is superb and it feels extremely premium. The camera is amazing and the sound quality is loud with a clear output. Overall an excellent phone.,

36,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like how durable this phone is, when I dropped for the first time it was too tall drop and a minor dent was only damage done to my phone.Coming to battery life it will easily fulfil your day.The camera on this phone still better than OnePlus 6T and other smartphoneIm writing this review after a year and half and saw this price I only suggest you just go for it feel the QUALITY!!!",
37,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I’m giving one star due to its poor performance in data connectivity. The internet connectivity is very bad. My iPhone 5s was far far better as compared to iPhone 7 performance in terms of connectivity. It has been 36 days since I bought this phone and I already feeling like throwing this phone n go for some android phone. I had a good conversation with the apple support n he also could not figure out the issue n asked me to go to a apple store n get it checked.,
38,Amazon Customer,24 March 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  From the time I bought the iPhone 7, it shut off, then went dead. Dud a soft restart & a hard reset. Still does not work. Amazon will not accept it back. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON. They cheat you.",

   I placed order on 21st November, 2020 from Appario Retail Pvt Ltd. Received it today(24th Nov). The box was in good condition, with no signs of damage. The month of manufacture was November 2019 and the product is genuine (confirmed serial number). But it wasn't powering on. On connecting charger, Apple logo comes on screen and again goes off. I contacted Amazon support via chat. I was told that as per Apple policy, I have to contact Apple support. Apple advisor asked me to try charging for a few hours. As it didn't work, I took it to Apple authorized service center. They suspected defective hardware and sent the device for inspection._______________________________________________________________________________________Update: The device I got was defective and I got it replaced by Apple Service Provider",

42,Arjun Prabhu,8 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Obviously this product from descendants of Mr Steve Jobs is pure value for money. I would always recommend to go for this unless you are planning to go for an Android device. And yess !! Be ready to spend some more on other connectivity accessories and its truly said “With great power comes great responsibility”,

45,Mahesh Chitrashekar,14 February 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  iPhone 7 is excellentUsing iPhones since 2014 so no difficulty in handling the device.Fingerprint is fast and it improves as when the updates are released.Camera quality is very good compared to old devices in my caseBattery life depends on the usage, no of apps downloaded, how many times u do full charge etc.I will recommend to go for iPhone as u get timely updates which is a must for the better working of the device.There are some cons but if u are not concerned about it then go for it without thinking twice.Apple gives premium devices and Amazon gives best services. So I am satisfied with my purchase.",
46,Ranjit Dasgupta,9 July 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The moment I received the product I matched the IMEI and serial code on Apple’s website and it was genuine. I updated it to iOS 14.1 and I faced some battery issues for couple days as battery was draining really fast but it normalised with time.Performance is very smooth and I have faced no problems, switching between apps is smooth as cream, screen is beautiful and 7 works really fine in 2020 too.My use is pretty casual, no gaming, only few social media sites and blog reading, news reading, and it gives me 7-9 hours backup on one full charge easy. It may differ if you are a heavy user, some have reported as less as 3 hour backup, so consider this if you are a gamer or heavy user. In the screenshot, you can see that I had charged iPhone to 99% at 9:45 am, and I was almost on screen surfing through YouTube and it gave me almost 5 and a half hour of backup until battery level dropped at 19%.Satisfied purchase, thank you Amazon.",
47,Anowarus salam,23 February 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. I received a model that was manufactured in Nov 2019 (1-year old) and was completely discharged, which means that this product was lying unused for more than a year2. The phone has issues with touch and is not responsive a lot of times. This is obvious with any electronic item that remains unused for such a long time3. Amazon is refusing to accept return or provide any form of support on the issue and I am expected to make rounds of Apple service center and spend hours chatting to support teams on a brand new phone that I have paid full price for4. As per Amazon's policy which is mentioned under a hidden tab Amazon will not return/replace this unless you receive a wrong product. So, in essence once you purchase you are on your own5. The entire point of purchasing online is the assurance that the product will be replaced in an unlikely scenario. If that assurance is taken away then buying online makes no sense considering you don't even get to physically see the product before purchasing6. My request to all the readers is to not purchase this product from Amazon and Appario as the policies are not clearly mentioned on the product page and there is no support provided in a genuine case7. After this experience, my trust in Amazon has gotten seriously impacted. I request other buyers to be doubly sure before placing trust on Amazon on expensive products",
48,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing this review after 2 + years of purchase. Typing from the same phone..hehe...It's an amazing phone. Which was delivered tome by Amazon really quick and well packed.The phone has not given me any problems.I was an android users and couldn't keep a phone for more than 6-8 months without it showing signs of failure. They used to hang... Become slow...heat up....etc....But this beauty is as solid as a rock...I have dropped it.... Got stamped by shoes...on the road..(had a tempered glass protector which was shattered) but nothing happened to the phone....Lovely battery capacity.Overall, even today, with all the other iPhones releasing one after the other....this is a phone worth buying if you have budget restraints...Don't hesitate.",
49,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Was little nervous after ordering it coz i saw some negative feedback AFTER PLACING THE ORDER. I thought i would probably get an OLD phone or a BRICK delivered instead of a new phone, whereas all of that Phantasmagoria was vanished as i have received a brand new phone which works perfectly well. Not too sure why people left those negative comments. Would suggest all interested buyers to go ahead give it a shot as its worth the money you would pay. By the way i also order a Cover and a Screen-guard later as i was sure that i wont get bricks anymore. Lol cheers",

51,Amazon Customer,4 July 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The phone I ordered didn’t power up at all.. very bad quality and really pathetic service from Amazon... they would not issue me a replacement and now have to go to apple stores (in this COVID situation - no option of doing virtually) to get Amazon a “service denial letter” before they give any sort of support to me.. please consider carefully before you purchase iPhones from Amazon.. they actually asked me to read up the policy (fine print) and that they cannot help me at all of the piece is defective.. better to go to a local retailer for such any high end purchase,
52,kundan kumar,12 September 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been an iphone user since a while and my iphone 5s needed to be upgraded and I was waiting for a good deal. Though I would have liked a better discount I decided to make the best use of Amazon's Prime Sale!The phone has been with about 2 days and its quite early to be able to really comment, however I have faith in Apple. The phone gets quite warm on prolonged use and if this continues I might have to ask for a replacement. Are you there Amazon?",
53,Pranav,16 June 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought the product during the great Indian festival sale in October. I really doubt the product is original. Not even been a year the battery life is non existent and camera just refuses to open sometimes. Please do not fall into the trap and invest so much with this seller to just save a few thousand bucks.,
54,Hitesh,12 June 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice product..however earpiece volume is little bit concern So some time I repent why I wasted 40k for just phone..also the abolition of 3.5mm jack also annoying (u will have to plug in plug out Digital to Analog converter if you missed ur original earphone which last up to just 6 or 8 months (wire cutting problem from jack ) also it tangles so much and u need 4-5 minutes to solve the puzzle before listening music.Good product specially camera is ultimate far far better than others 10 MP/20 MP.,

56,Siddhārth,5 November 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was a fan of apple before my iphone 7, this one and the one I bought few months before this hanged and died. There is a standard reply to pay price of a new phone and get it changed.Problems include power issues, charging issues, restarting, battery die, etc. I would rater buy anything but never apple",

60,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This was a total waste of money. The gadget cannot hold any power and it is utter disappointing after spending so much money. Unfortunately the return window is closed and due to Covid lockdown I could not return it within the specified period,
61,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone usage for two days reduced battery capacity to 98% and took 5hours to fully charge. I didn't bother to raise complaint with Amazon, instead made a visit Apple authorized service center-iCare and initially they were reluctant to accept the issue and tried to convince on its normal based on the usage!! finally they accepted it and said phone as multiple issues!! and got new replacement phone within a week.So, even if the phone is brand new, phones will be with some known factory defects.Only good thing is that Apple service didn't make any difference even if phone brought from retailer like Amazon, or may be they can't do that as the phone was showing valid serial and warranty.The new replacement phone is all good.",
62,Vivek,31 May 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a good phone, great experience but I received a defective piece. Apple service center didn't help either.",
63,Vishal Vartak,26 November 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,  After receiving my item I checked battery health and it was 97 percent. In new phone it was impossible. I was sure that the item was an used one. Tried to replace the item several times but the link was not working for replace. Then I contacted with Amazon by telling that the product is not as per description of Amazon. Hence want to replace it. After 18 days when I am able to contact with customer care I am informed it is my own fault. Thanks both Amazon and Apple for selling a used item to me in the name of brand new item.,
64,Raj Kumar Haralalka,18 July 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Three things1) The product I received was dead.. it was not switching on2) I didnot receive any 3.5mm adapter which was mentioned in product specifications3) inspite of amazon saying 7 day replacement... It does not allow you to place replacement and redirect to apple care.YOU CANNOT REPLACE THIS PRODUCT IF IT IS FAULTY.,
65,Pranav,20 July 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I will jot down some features for this phone:Pros:1. Very sturdy military grade aluminium body.2. Good battery backup.3. Water resistant.4. Awesome performance, no lags at all.5. What more could one ask for.Cons:1. 3.5 mm audio jack cannot be used and the headphones come with lightning connectors. So you cannot charge and listen to music at the same time. This is actually not a con but some may feel so, trust me as I have been using it for quite some time now, I do not have any grudges.2. That's all folks.Verdict:Best budget iphone that is water resistant and very sturdy.",

69,RAHUL,26 January 2021,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazon gave me defective product. I tried to switch on the iPhone 7 many times but I failed then I contacted customer care. After two days a service maintener came at my home he told me phone is dead. Please do not purchase any product from Amazon. The employee of this company is not working truely i think they are exchange the product in the midway. I am facing the problem to return iphone 7. Please do not purchage any product from amazon,
70,Raveendar M,25 October 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was so excited after reciving iphone. But i didn't feel anything better in iphone than android now after 3 years storage sucks literally. It has problem with volume. you can't even hear other person's voice untill unless you are on speaker. Same problem with friends phone too he bought with me same phone.  Everytime i have to put myself on speaker for even private talks. Storage is the biggest issue. If you have downloded something it automatically uninstall all the apps. When in need you have to wait for app install. I feels like m in the grandfathers era. One of the biggest disadvantage, It doesn't support any earphone, you have to buy original apple earphone. It is just a waste of money and time. you can't even talk to people while charging is on cuase of their so called one jack :(I will never buy iphone and won't even recommend anyone to buy because it is not worth the money. This made my life almost hell.",

73,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using iPhone for long. I was planning to buy an iPhone my brother since he is in class 10 and what would be better than iPhone 7. Since he has not much to use 32 gb was quiet okay. After placing an order on Amazon my feet were cold as I read so many negative comments and honestly speaking even a day before getting this device I was going through the Amazon comment section. At last I just prayed to lord and said whatever will happen I ll face it. Fortune enough that there was 0 glitch. Battery health full 100%, device update to lasted version iOS 14.3. I have no issue with the phone. To all who are going to see my uploaded pictures please don’t think anything bad of this device I got the screen guard and back cover lamentation so that’s why my iPhone is reflecting. Thank you Amazon for your generous service",
74,sherin,29 May 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Can’t hear the voice over the phone calls. Can’t believe Apple can produce such sick device that it won’t work with the basic need  to be fulfilled through a phone. I need this device to be thoroughly checked. Either Apple or Amazon is at fault.You guys wasted my 2 days time. It sucks. Who will bear the loss of time wastage for phone n data transfer etc? Refund immediately. Get it picked. Facing problem in transferring my whole data in previous device now.,

76,Salil S.,23 September 2017,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Exchanged my HTC One A9 for this.  Both felt the same in my hand, which is a good thing. I definitely didn't want any of the ugly oversized phones that are so popular now. This phone is Sturdy. I dropped it a few times when traveling..once, right on its glass face from a height of ~3 feet. It fell down on one of those rough, jagged granite steps we see everywhere in India. Barely a scratch. In the last one year, my iPhone 7 has picked up a few tiny spots on the back where the paint has come off, but nothing that would take away from its great looks. This thing has survived a fair bit of abuse, without a phone case. Will hold on to this one a while longer because the newer X series phones are bulky and I read that they get scratched easily. Everything else is as expected on an iPhone - it all just works really well. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the fingerprint reader isn't the best in the market. If you are considering buying this, I highly recommend it.",
77,Susovan Mukherjee,1 December 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  After 2yr of usage, I am writing this reviewAll knows, iOS is performance and security features, I don't have any questions on its capability.Within last 2yr two times, I contacted it's service center for different software issues, I never faced any such issues in any other devices.Last one, I faced was, speaker greyout issue, that was the end of my apple story.General , this phone is the best if it working.They have lots of hw and sw issues, if you are unlucky and your phone fall in to anyone of it, you are in trap.They don't have skilled labours in their services center to replace any part of the board, so mostly suggest you to replace the phone.I wish good luck of iphone lovers!Best Practice: get extended warranty for ur phone and renew it as much possible. Extended warranty provided by third pary mobile sellers(I didn't find this option in Amazon, or Apple planent).",

79,Aanubrata,10 January 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My 2nd iPhone 7 till date...love the compact size of the phone and the premium feel of the aluminium body.Battery life is the major draw back..moderate use will leave you with 20% by the end of the day(FB,chatting,instagram) ..not for heavy media users.Cameras ,both front n back are good but a bit  over saturated.Speaker volume decent.Performance top notch.4/5 for this.",

82,Bikku ,15 December 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  What do I say? You know how this phone is. Aluminium back, Taptic 3D touch, taptic home button differentiate this from 6s and 8. In my opinion, this is the best out of the 3 overall. I bought it for 39,000, wish it was cheaper, around 32,000 or something. But oh well, Apple is apple, so good it doesn't depreciate.",

87,RAJESH,21 October 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Had iphone6 and now I have upgraded to iphone7. Was able to see the difference immediately. iphone 7 is much faster than iphone6. Picture clarity is better. Both camera and selfie camera are excellent.  Battery life is almost as similar as iphone6. All this combined with Amazon superfast delivery as well. Good Value for money. We can go for it.,
88,jitendra,18 August 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sometimes we can’t hear the voice of other callers. This happens during the call. Can’t blame the network as no such issues with other phone’s. Also if need to use the hotspot, then we need forget any active WiFi connection in the mobile. Otherwise instead of its own data, it will connect another WiFi. Thus not allowing us to share available networks for multiple devices",

90,Iffat,11 December 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly, I would like to say that customers should not buy any Apple products from Amazon, since its a third party app. If you have any problem you wouldn't be able to return it. Although they'll show the return window still you will have to go through Apple customer support and in real you can't return. And going through Apple Support is very hectic as they might not accept if the product is damaged or defective or you have any other problem. So I request everyone not to buy from this app. Better visit the retail store and if not there you can at least ask them to arrange it for you, which they will. Secondly, as a Brand and product, overall performance is good but there's a major issue which is almost common for IPhones that is, while calling you might hear very low volume of the person you are talking to and unless you connect your headphones you can't hear them which is a major problem when you're outdoors. Camera and battery is satisfactory if you use it on a normal level otherwise it might go down soon. As a secondary phone it is quite good but I won't suggest it if you want it as a primary one. Lastly, Android phones are far better than IPhones compared to the price you pay and features you get. If you can afford you can always go ahead, but for middle class people it's best not to waste your hard earned money on Apple products unless you really want to. However if you still want to have it as a name or just to explore Apple then you're welcome. But otherwise just to pay so much money and ultimately getting no satisfaction is a total waste of both. Good luck!",

94,Ch. Jagadeeswara rao,10 February 2021,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have an entire cavalry of Apple products at my place - macbook air, pro, iMac, iPad - and none of the above mentioned products have disappointed me, even when the usage is on a higher end.  I stay in the US and since I couldn't personally send an iPhone to my dad I used Amazon (dot) in's service and it has been a very disappointing experience. The phone heats up even when no third party application has been installed. Without no usage the battery drains out of power and I am pretty confident that this phone has been unboxed before. But keeping the allegations aside, PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON rather buy from an APPLE STORE instead. It might be a little costly or your city might not have an apple store at the first place but it will save you the disappointment of putting so much amount of money into something and not reaping the benefits.Also, I would like to mention that for my family I also bought an iPad with the same purchase, which is working in a great shape and there is no functional defects but 50% of your purchase turns out to be faulty is a big RED flag.",

Many of the less known products are being reported to be far better than this one.I gave all one stars for other bundled products I bought with this one as I simply feel that Amazon is selling bad products on its website without any quality feed or checks.

113,Ishwar,15 October 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mobile Phones have become the sort of devices that many of us, just can't live without. And if your one of these people then I would suggest you not purchase this phone. (Review written after using the phone for 5 months).It has a very Old A10 Bionic chipset that gets you through most of the light to moderate usage, but when it comes to any performance-intensive task you're left out to dry. It has a single 12 Megapixel camera on the back which can click decent, if not, great photos. The front camera provides decent performance in well-lit conditions. The 32 Gb internal storage runs out in about 2-3 months and you'll have to either backup data to a different device or buy their ICloud storage(I wouldn't suggest the latter option because it's just a trick to get you into apple's ""Ecosystem""). The phone is powered by a 1960 Mah battery that lasts about 5 hours max if you use it for menial tasks such as browsing the internet or checking your email. If you intend to purchase this phone, I would suggest also investing in a good power bank.It comes with an IOS 10 out of the box, but you can expect software support from apple until next year, at which time they'll probably stop supporting iPhone 7 altogether. It comes with a 4.7 inch IPS LCD screen and the phone's form factor is very compact and it can easily fit into your hands. The rear camera does well in daylight conditions and the finish of the phone does look beautiful.So if you're a mobile user who uses their phone very lightly, wants a compact and good-looking phone that will probably be supported up to a maximum of 2 years (Illusional optimism at best), with a decent, if not great, camera for the price range. Then this is the phone your looking for. But, that being said, I still wouldn't suggest this phone because it barely provides the apple experience people buy an iPhone for, and more often than not, you're left with a feeling of desperation of having an iPhone but not quite having it.",

When both the hardware and software is managed by the same company you can expect the phone to keep up with time unlike many other phone manufacturers who stop with out of the box software. The main con is battery life. To provide a sleek phone Apple cuts on battery size and hence don’t expect too much of on screen time if you’re a gaming enthusiast or watch a lot of videos on phone. The stand by time however is great because of the latest software update. Overall a good phone to experience the Apple space.,

After flighting Amazon accepted return but Amazon pick up partner is not willing to pick up the mobile and it has not yet picked up. Everytime I am contacting in Amazon for the same issue,even escalated the same to Amazon Higher Escalation (Jeff) but the team also making me fool and everything changing their commitment and giving me new date to resolve it. Also the pick up team is claiming on me that some time the team says that returing wrong time and some customer address wrong. But truth is that no one is coming to collect at my home, even not making me call as well. Please Amazon work on your service and stop to claim on Amazon.",
124,Vivek,26 January 2021,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not at all happy with the product as it doesn’t seem genuine. The battery doesn’t last for even 2 hours after charging for 100%. It gets heated while charging and while using most of the applications. And the worst is it hangs Sometimes which I never experienced in any of the Apple products I have been using for more than 10 years. Also the replacement and return policy of Amazon sucks these days. Earlier Amazon used to be very customer friendly but now they are the worst. I ordered the black colour and I find it very surprising at the huge difference in price just because of colour which is baffling. A difference of 7-8k just for colour is not justified and I feel after the second phone which I returned eventually that there is some different in the quality between the Black colour and other colours,

I love the fact that its screen is 4.7 inches as this means it can fit into my pocket very comfortably. The display is also very good. The software updates about a week or so after the phone is registered with an Apple ID. The touch screen is smoother than my roomie's HTC phone which apparently cost 40,000 (I bought this for 30,000 just before the launch of iPhone 11, which pushed the price down to about 27,000). All in all, this is not a decision that I regret.",

2859,Aravind reddy,17 January 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly, let me clarify.. I do not belong to Apple Die hard fans and followers' club.I too was drawn towards this device as a replacement when my Moto E First Gen one fine day stopped working and didn't recover.So this is a transition from Android to iOS.Am I missing Android ? Honestly - NO.I thought it's time to buy a perfect and latest device for myself, not because I was completely sure of what it does, just because I could now afford it.I know, iPhone 8 and iPhone X are in the market today. But this phone in every respect is still relevant today and in no way can be considered outdated. If you wish you buy an iPhone that doesn't hit your pocket much and is not outdated, this is the most perfect phone to buy today.Buying 6 or 6s would be a risk because apple might stop supporting its update in a few years.As I mentioned, this review is not from a crazy Apple product lover. (Although it may sound like one)Pros:1. The screen dimensions and phone size is perfect. It's exactly what I need. Not too thick and not extremely flimsy. Though some might prefer the iPhone 7 plus, I think it's too big to carry in your pocket.2. Processor and Speed: this I noticed not just about this iPhone but for iPad also, the processor speed is really awesome. Windows laptops, android phones and tabs do hang and freeze. This phone in last one year has NEVER. It might not sound much of a big deal but usually phones hang when you desperately need them in urgency and you don't want to be in that position ever.3. Screen Quality: the screen looks amazing and Colors are extremely fine.4. Camera: now please note that this is not a DSLR. So no matter how much the phone companies advertise, phone cameras will always be inferior to a professional DLSR. That's the reason why camera companies aren't out of business. Having said that, the camera of this phone (both front and back) are really good and they do their job.6. No Headphone Jack: I thought it would be a matter of concern, but it isn't. It has only motivated me to take care of my headphone even more and that's the only reason they are still intact and working properly. I am sure you won't miss the jack. Besides, if you fear losing the small adapter, it's better to buy Bluetooth headphones. They fit it really well with this phone.7. Cross platform flexibility: this is what I was most worried about. How this device would blend in with my windows laptop and all other apps and features which I earlier used in windows and Android. Surprisingly, the transition was smooth and hassle free. There may be people who disagree, but I never missed any feature which android provided. Infact, itunes, iCloud and other apple features have made the life much easier as compared to android.8. 32 GB storage: I think it's sufficient today. Most people use their phones as storage devices. If you're one of them then even 256GB variant is not enough. So install the apps you actually use, backup the photos in to your laptop regularly, put videos and songs only the ones you listen and actually watch. You will surprise yourself that filling up 32GB space is also difficult.Now, most importantly...CONS:1. Body Finishing: You have to have a back cover for this phone in order to avoid it slipping from your hands. The tighter you grip it without cover, the easily it would slip.Also, I initially used a cover which had a seive pattern on it. The same pattern got imprinted on back of the phone (though not easily visible). Go for an all solid or all plastic cover which can provide grip.2. Battery backup: The battery backup of this phone is bit of a problem. With moderate usage also, it can consume battery before the end of the day and you have to be very economical about it.3. No dual sim: I know, many would frown after reading this. And I know why Apple has still not released a dual sim iPhone.. but I wish this phone was dual sim. The other 2 cons can be mitigated, this one however can only be settled by having a backup phone. Add the Dual sim feature and apple would bring in a swarm of new users who hesitated from iPhone.iPhone ACCESSORIES RECOMMENDATION1. Screen Guard: you may go for any standard screen guard but honestly you don't need one. No screen guard can protect your screen from breaking. I have not used any screen guard for more than year and the screen looks as new. Just make sure you don't put the keys and phone in the same pocket and surely phone will shine for years. Also, let me mention here that my phone HAS FALLEN from a decent height face down on solid floor twice but the glass is strong enough to sustain without absolutely no physical damage.2. Back cover: I think this is a must accessory. You need not spend much on this. Egotude transparent color (black shade) will go perfectly with it. It provides the necessary grip and scratch resistance to your phone back.3. Headphones: in case you lose your Apple earphones, as per your budget, buy a Bluetooth headset, something that suits your pocket and you're good to go.4. Cleaning Spray and Cloth: If you wish to keep your phone new and clean, please invest in this. It's a very small investment but the returns are huge. Buy any camera lens cleaning Spray and soft cloth. Every 10-15 days, take the phone out of cover and thoroughly clean the phone and cover as well. Your phone will shine a little longer and will look brand new for years. All it needs is just a little touch of care from you.Hope the review helps. Cheers 🖖🏻",
2860,Amazon Customer,28 April 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overview - On the outside, the new iPhone looks basically the same as the iPhone 6/6s. They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they’re not fully waterproof, keep them submerged in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not go your way.Once you wrap your head around the missing audio jack (it's not the end of it, you can get a designated adapter for your favorite headphones), the Apple iPhone 7 is a major upgrade. IP67-certified water-resistant body. Bigger and brighter camera with OIS. New FaceTime cam. Stereo speakers. Faster processor and 50% GPU performance increase, more RAM. New pressure-sensitive Home key powered by a new taptic engine. Revised storage options.Battery - iPhone 7 is powered with the newest A10 Fusion chip. It is a quad core processor which helps in better managing the battery life. It takes around 2hrs to completely charge from 0-100% and the battery usually lasts a day. I am a heavy user, and use the phone quite a lot during the day. Whatsapp, Twitter, Calling and Messaging are the main battery draining apps for me. I will be left with 20-25% battery at the end of the day with typical usage.Performance - Apple made the best mobile chipset from which others can only learn from. Its dual-core processor, even without the help of the tiny energy efficient cores, beats any other processor out there. The A10 GPU is equally impressive acing every graphic benchmark. The iPhone 7 is the fastest and most powerful smartphone in the world as of now.Audio - iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, considering my previous iPhone was the 5s, it is a huge upgrade for me in the audio performance. Loudspeaker is pretty good, audio output is loud and clear. Call quality is damn good.Camera - The colors and contrast are great and the dynamic range is simply great - much like you would get on dedicated big cameras. In any case, the iPhone 7 delivers the most balanced dynamic range from any smartphone at the moment. The optical image stabilization is the addition that really matters as it will keep the lens steady and won't allow for blurry shots at low-light. The front-facing camera got its resolution boosted to 7MP and records 1080p video. It can use Retina flash, where your screen lights up in different colors depending on the intended white balance of the scene. Pretty good when taking selfies in dark environment. Coming to the 4k video recording, it is the best camera when it comes to 4k Video, Period.Overall a great package and the phone will definitely last 3+ years if used carefully. There won't be any performance issues considering Apple will provide updates regularly and the phone won't lag after using it for a year or so unlike the android phones. The phone is also water and dust resistant, if we accidentally end up dropping the phone in water, there is no need to worry. The phone can even be used to take pictures in swimming pool and shallow water(Be careful with the depth of water else phone will be toast). Putting a case and a screen protector will ruin the beauty of phone and the phone won't feel the same, but if you are the one who drops the phone constantly then Case and Screen protectors are necessary evils. I got it for a price of 36500/- in the Great Indian Sale :pAbsolutely Loving it !!",
2861,ATUL SHANKARAN,6 November 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery was on time, product is legit with a proper Indian warranty as well.But the iPhone 7 I got has a 'microphone' issue, giving a hissing sound in the voice calls and video recordings... Trying to sort out with the apple service care, though they r taking a long time",

2863,kishankhanna,23 August 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Excellent phone. Light weight and classy. I was only worried about a refurbished iphone being sold as new. But the phone was new and am very  happy about it. It arrived early too. Worth buying it during the shopping festival.Only challenge would be to move data from the old phone which I think no one has mastered yet.,
2864,Regunath,8 November 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The phone started giving trouble in 5 months after purchase and Apple refused to honour the warranty. Simply refused perhaps as it was purchased from AmazonThe complaint with Amazon is pending for redressal.,
2865,Bhupendra Rajput,18 December 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Good: The iPhone 7 has the biggest key features anyone want: a fast processor, water resistance, a more durable solid-state home button, and still really good cameras with rear optical image stabilization. iOS 12 is help this phone to perform even better than on iOS 11.The Bad:Lacks the extra speed and improved camera quality of the iPhone 8. No fancy Face ID or other iPhone X-type designs. No headphone jack (an adapter comes in the box). No wireless charging.The Bottom Line:The gap between iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 isn’t as great as I think, and for the right price, this is still an excellent pick if you’re not chasing the latest bleeding-edge iPhone and want to save some money.",
2866,Amazon Customer,2 February 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice mobile but after iOS 11 updates its started to hang and performance is slow battery life is also not that good can only use for 4-5 hrs and it needs to be charger overall it’s a good but costly product  but not at all value for money. I am writing this review after one year of use and yes it’s water proof but after it’s splashed with water it’s speaker 🔊 doesn’t work you have to make sure that all the water 🚿 has been removed or leave it for 30-40 min then only you can have clear sound all in all product is good but not at all value for money 10-15 k is added to its price for nothing,
2867,Sumallya,24 October 2017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  it is been 10 moths now, i'm still in love with my I phone7. never went slow, best picture taken, best ever display... dont think much.. if yo decided for i Phone buy it now :).it's design, color, everything is top of this world.Thank you Apple for making this beautiful/ awesome /gorgeous yet best gadget in the world.:)",
2868,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got the iPhone 7 for 43K on Prime Day Sale. Have been using it for almost a month now. It came in authentic Apple box. Checked all the contents inside after opening. All genuine. Mine was shipped by Cloudtail. The experience has been sublime so far.I'm a convert, from Android to iOS. The first thing that struck me after using the phone for the very first time was that it's super user friendly. The M10 processor is the fastest processor on a smartphone yet. It's capable of performing endless tasks in one go. I didn't even bother to switch off any background apps for a few days. It's damn fast. Also, the iPhone is built in such a way that it can extract the maximum juice out of its hardware. Its 2GB RAM is more than capable of performing all your tasks without any fuss.The camera is impressive too. The pictures have minimum noise. The details are pretty sharp. I've seen a better camera phone than this though (OnePlus 3/3T, for instance).The stereo speakers are one of the best speakers in a smartphone right now. Their performance is awesome. The sound gives a theatre like feel to the music. The EarPods are great too. I'd recommend to set the volume at 50% though. They can get pretty loud.The battery backup is decent enough. My phone lasts the entire day on full charge. I only charge it once in 24 hours. Lasts about 2/3rd of the day on mixed usage (browsing, video playback, music).All in all, it's a worthy investment as you'll get updates for three years and the hardware is capable enough to last that long.Also, get a solid case for protection from slips as it's a bit on the slippery side. Spigen is a good option.Go for it if you've been thinking of switching loyalties.",
2869,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hahah when it comes to writing ,I am lazy. Still I must say, it's a wonderful piece of art. And I must be one among those lucky people who got iPhone 7 at a price of 43824/- on 1st July and next day they revised price to 47k and finally to 49k.Best thing: Camera: Live option is pretty cool,Battery, Fingerprint. Processor speedBad thing : it's been a month and am yet to find one. Cool. Just buy and you gonna love the user interface. Coz I am using android also, last week one of my colleague gave her Lenovo to download some app, I must say I took 5 minutes to find play store in that phone. Here things are streamlined, and android to apple data transfer, perfect. :) Delighted customer",

Experience is far better than Android with amazing picture quality that matches good cameras. Easy to install and transfer from old Android phone than before.,
2874,Prashant Chavan,16 September 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is as good as it looks. The feel, the performance and the style all compliment each other..!The camera is just perfect and gives you the click you deserve..!People might say that an iPhone does not have the additional features an Android has, for all those I would simply say....""If you don't have an iPhone you don't have an iPhone.""Go for it without a second thought..!",
2875,abinash chand,30 October 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good phone but go for iPhone 7plus if you can..Camera and audio both are good but battery could have been slightly bigger May be 2500 mAhIn heavy use with gaming and internet battery lasts for 4 to 4.5 hrs. If not used, after a full charge  battery will be around 95 to 92 % after 8 hrs..Screen size is bit small compared to other phones therefore phone is also small and very slim..make sure that u purchase cover immediately after purchasing phone..it is bit slippery..I purchased for 39500 at time of Amazon flash sale..processor is quite fast and no lags during heavy gaming can be noticed..Front camera is also good..Still I will suggest to go for iPhone 7 plus if you are bot tight on budget..I'm posting this review after 2 months use..Thanks",
2876,Abdul malik,24 November 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This was the first iPhone that I have owned but I  have gone through a lot of iPhones in the past. One the best phones I have seen in recent times. The build quality, the smoothness with which it works and the features it has is just simply superb. The camera is so good that it can almost compete with a DSLR. Thank you Amazon... I was a little upset with the packaging of the product as it was shabby but the iPhone box was not damaged.",
2877,Girish Gajera,8 August 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The battery life of this product is so much better that iPhone 5s and 6s. The colour is really good and I think Apple should have continued with this colour. The size is perfect. It’s not to big as the plus series. Definitely a good buy. There is hardly any difference between iPhone 7 and iPhone 8. So I would suggest you go for this product as is cheaper as well.,
2878,vijay,19 July 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my 1st ever Apple purchase for me. Till now I don't have any complaints but if you compare 1 to 1 features with any of the premium phones available in the market. It lags behind. You can buy it if you want a brand name, security, and fast phone. If you want a bright screen, better battery backup, premium looks and loaded with features then this phone is not for you.Pros:- If compared with previous version - Improved cameras (Front and Rear), screen and battery life.- Faster than any other smartphone available.- Water resistance- Powerful dual speakers (Better than any other phone)- Good Storage space.Cons:- Iterative design- Many of the ""groundbreaking"" features have been on Android phones for a while.- It's expensive if features are compared with another premium phone.",

2885,NAVDEEP KAUR,15 December 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using iPhone 7 from last 9 months and my experience is amazing either in terms of user interface or camera or sound or the most important it’s speed. Even 4 or 6 gb of android may not have processing as fast as iPhone.Battery life is also good but the only drawback is it’s heating a little bit if I use it in temperature that go beyond the recommended range for its surrounding temperature.Rest everything is good.

2891,Sumeet,8 December 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Superb phone at excellent 39 k price. It has been carved as a general perception that ios offers less as compared to similarly priced android but the truth is ios is far more advanced and litter free and secure,etc. Once you start using ios you would never feel like using an android phone ever again in your life. The only area where android wins is bigger battery life that too has been optimized with ios11. Actually ios11 has bridged all major gaps in ios that were present based upon which people used to create the false impression that ios is inferior to android.",

IF you want ADDITIONAL STORAGE the pricing is as follows : >>>50GB- Rs 75/month .  PER YEAR  it comes to 75*12=900Rs(for 1 year )...1,800Rs(for 2 years)...2,700Rs (for 3 years) >>>200 GB- Rs220/month.

(My brother lost his iPhone 7 Plus 128 gb during ganpati visarjan but got  45K back due to insurance.)_____________________________________________________________________________________IPHONE 7  V/S  IPHONE 8 . WHAT TO BUY ?If you already have an iPhone 7 there is no point wasting money for the iPhone 8 . You may wait for the iPhone 10.If you compare iPhone 7 and 8 the iPhone 8 is just going to be a bit faster than the older iPhone 7. Lot more processing ,opens faster and faster gaming than iPhone 7. No major changes to get excited about .Prices of the iPhone 7 and 7 plus have come down drastically and I would recommend going for the 7/7plus . If you have the money and are willing to wait then you can go for the iPhone 10.NOTE: will update my review after unboxing  iPhone 8 and 10.**********UPDATE (8th OCTOBER 2017)************Apple investigates reports iPhone 8 Plus batteries BURST OPEN while phone charges. After this news I feel that people should not buy the new iPhone 8/8plus and iPhone X till this matter is solved .Will KEEP on UPDATING.............",

3112,LIKHITHYADAV,29 June 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Apple iPhone 7 (Black, 32GB)

Review for Apple IPhone 7 - 32GB - Purchased during the last sale of Amazon at a cost of rs. 39,999 . The cost seemed to be on a higher side initially, however since I have been using Android for last 4-5 years, and already made my mind to move from Android , so I had no choice if I wanted to upgrade. There were two choices Apple 6s and Apple IPhone 7. I chose 7 since this was a higher version with improved processor as compared to 6s.Well, actually IPhone 7 does not need a review, however since I generally review every product I buy from Amazon, this is again the same.Not going much with the Specs, the first thing I noticed is that this phone never hangs as compared to the recent Android Nougat which stands no where in comparision to IOS 11. IOS 11 is much stable than Nougat. IOS used 2 GB ram very effectively which an Android phone with 4 GB Ram also could not use it very optimised. The IPhone can multitask easily, the applications can run in background without affecting the performance of the application which is in foreground. This does not impact the application you are using currently. Well, coming to the delivery, the Amazon Prime delivery was amazing , the phone was delivered within 48 hours of the order. This is so far the most stable phone I have used.1. Not bulky.2. The screen is 4.7 inches, fits easily in your pocket.",

3303,disha kuchekar,20 July 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Seven is the first iPhone I ever owned. Always loved the product but shied away because of the price tag. But this time I said ""what the heck"" and took the plunge. Love the phone since day 1. There are lot of arguments out there saying ""why do u need such an expensive phone?"", ""There are phones lower the cost with lot more features"" etc. But it all comes down to choice. What all features you need. To me battery life is very important. This black box of wonder gives me two days of battery life with moderate usage (no games. This is not a gaming machine to me). That feature really helps when I am travelling. I hate charging my phones at travel ports. Then the seamless connectivity that it has with other electronics and the wonderful apps just make the price tag worth it. All said, buy the phone only if the features suit your need.",

Nice thouch.3. Awesome Camera, front and rear both.4. All day battery backup on JIO 4G Network.5. Awesome music sound.6.

If I compare the 7 with the other phones in the market, it is so much elegant and has one of the best camera quality.  I totally love this phone, the LED display is beautiful, the colors on screen are bright and perfect.There are good differences compared to 6 & 6S and not many differences compared to 8 & X (this one doesn't have augmented camera or wireless charging) but everything looks similar and the same.Yes, the headphones jack point is now officially gone from iPhone 7 and I don't see this a major issue except now you need to be alot more careful with your iPhone headphones.",

3313,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had to move out of my Android LG Nexus 5 to Apple iPhone due to security vulnerability on Android which caused my company to block emails on Android phones which don't have latest patches from Google. Google stops patching phones 3 yrs from launch.I had heard so much about iPhone and I decided to go for it since there is no security issue and people using iPhone 5c are also still getting patches.While it was delivered on time, I wasn't happy with first impressions for the following reasons:1) Move to iOS app wasn't working and had a tough time getting stuff migrated.2) Phone is getting very hot within minutes of powering on. I can't hold this phone in hand for few minutes. This phone is way too expensive to have these kind of issues.3) I am used to ""OK Google"" giving me fantastic search results. This ""Hey Siri"" is giving vague and stupid results.4) It's taking way too long to charge.I expected more from Apple, I am going to return this phone and get a Google Pixel.",

If you're still deciding... GET THIS",
3315,Karthik,2 October 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had been using this phone for the past 7 months so can give you my perspective.I Had been using Android flagship( that too a nexus) for over past few years. And that nexus was unusable after 2 years.And on top of that Google stopped android updates after 2 yrs of phone's release which was main driving force for me to switch over to Apple.And that decision could never have been better.So coming to phone itself,it's amazing. Let's list them as pros and cons:Pros:1.UI is buttery smooth2. Camera is great with snappier response.3. Processor is way ahead of the Android counter parts.4. Many Ios apps are better optimized than.  android versions.5. Dust and water resistant. (IP67)6. Thin,light and amazing for one handed use.7. Great battery life can last you a day easily with moderate to heavy use.8. Future ios updates are guaranteed unlike in case of Android.9. Best IPS panel in the market with spectacular viewing angles.10. Call quality is best in class.Cons:1. Low resolution screen (720p)2. Kind of limited flexibility as compared to android (which is a trade of you have to make if u buy ios devices)",

3319,Ketan,10 October 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all, iPhone 7 nails it when it comes to battery. Being a high end smartphone, iPhone 7 shows amazing battery backup. This is my first iPhone and I was a heavy android user. I have used nexus devices, mi devices and also moto devices but the battery and RAM performance of iPhone 7 is above all of them. I keep my 4G data on all the time and I keep on chatting, watching videos online, downloading updates over mobile data and after all of these the battery remains at 20% at the end of my day (12:30 am).The display is awesome, touch response is buttery smooth. The removal of the 3.5 mm jack doesn't make much of a difference as you don't need to keep your phone at chcarging all the time.Talking about charging, though it doesn't bear the name of a quick charger but the lightning bolt in iPhone charges the device pretty quickly than any other traditional device.The service from Amazon is simply amazing and I must say I am very happy with my purchase. After spending an amount of 45k+, I am really happy with the output I get.",
3320,Vivishek,29 August 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  In description there is clearly written ""1 year manufacturer warranty from date of purchase"". but apple warrenty portal showing 11 month warranty remaining. Means its a scam by Amazon. They are selling used product in name of new.",

However, the most alluring aspect of the device is its impeccable camera - from OIS technology to the aperture, everything combines to produce amazing images.

3354,Murali krishna,29 March 2018,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I was very much excited to buy first Apple product and had planned long back to buy an iPhone.Just loved the product and features.Camera is amazing and phone is faster than an android phone.I would have given 5 stars if the phone was delievered on time by amazon.,
3355,Rajiv,16 March 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India",

I am using a Matte Black finish. The company doesn't take any responsibility for the quality of surface finish that the phone has. There are quite a lot of users worldwide facing the same issue but the company has turned a blind eye to it. Shame that a company like Apple would do this to its customers.

3439,JALDEEP,22 August 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is no point in reviewing the phone itself since anyone who is actually interested in buying an iPhone would have read its reviews on the more relevant websites.I can talk about my experience of buying iPhone from amazon. The product is 100% original, its Indian iPhone model so don't be concerned about claiming the warranty should you need it.Some negatives:1)Even after paying for same day delivery I got my phone after one day2)Packaging of parcel was not so great(less bubble wrap) eventually damaging my iPhone box corners (apple enthusiasts love the product's box also, trust me)3)I bought it in march end but the phone manufacturing date is Dec-2016, making it 3 months old, this effects the battery to a minor level.Also you have to ensure that the warranty starts when you actually bought the product and not when the product was manufactured, with non-original product this is the first risk.",

3449,Naveen Madan,12 October 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have an iPad Air 128GB with sim. Used it extensively & recently it gave problems with my playing PUBG on it. Had little doubt at first buying it online & some reviews were negative. Then I went to buy my iPad’s charger; which had stopped working & other chargers were from Amazon were not upto the mark; form the same seller. Found the iPad Charger genuine; then went for this iPad & iPhone 7 Rose gold 32 GB, for my wife.This seller is genuine & while unboxing and setting it up iPhone 7, everything is perfectly new condition. Needless to say; my wife got both iPad Air (old but in prestine condition) & iPhone 7 almost at the same time.All the devices (three to be exact) I purchased from this seller is genuine & 1,500 ₹ to 1,700 ₹ cheaper than Apple’s store. If you have relatives/friends abroad, there you get it say approx 5,000 ₹ (after currency conversion). Previously the difference used to be 20,000 ₹ during the time iPhone 6 was out. It was worth the wait then.As far as packaging is concerned; Amazon has gone great lengths for delivering such high quality items; securely & promptly.",
3450,Siddhartha,14 August 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Please don’t buy. I thought amazon is a trusted site which provides best customer service.But it failed.I bought this product and first day when I tried to charge my phone it started heating. And battery file after 100% charge is not even an hour which is suprizing to me. I have been using iphones from very long and never felt heat even on long usage. And the worst part here is it jus shows that it provides 10dys replacmnt but after I faced this issue tried to place a replacmnt request using the replacmnt feature its getting navigated to support page asking to contact apple customer service .I really don’t understand the use of replacmnt feature that this amazon has kept for the product. Hell with this product and amazon service,

Almost lasts for a day with a full charge. Significantly better than the predecessor.- Most importantly, this time it is waterproof.Cons :- I had the iPhone 6S (16GB), I haven't noticed much difference and the aesthetics of the phone just feels the same. Not worth upgrading from an iPhone 6 / 6S.- No headphone jack. Have to insert the adaptor in order to use any external headphones with 3.5mm jack.- Screen quality is the same.Verdict : I feel the phone was overhyped while the phone is a very good buy for new iPhone users or anyone upgrading from 5S and below.",

3463,Deepak Singh,17 September 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too good a product by Apple! I've been using Android since 2013. Used stock ROM, custom ROM and what not. The smoothness of iPhone and iOS combined is unparalleled. Butter smooth interface. Brilliant camera. Good stereo speakers - till a limit. ""Hidden Shortcuts in iOS"" - finding one each day - being an ex-Android user. The only drawback which I found in my limited time full usage is that under heavy usage, the battery lasts only till evening 3/4 from 10 AM. This includes access to internet and listening to music on the ear pods most of the time. Addition of GPS and watching videos plus gaming reduces the battery life in half the time. But if you are frugal enough, you may stretch the day.However, it seems like Apple has given it fast charge capability, as every time I plug it into the batter bank, it reaches 50% in no time. But, it takes its sweet time to reach 100%. So, no complaints besides the requirement of a bit more juice in the battery. Having, said all, a very good package.",

3480,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Charging cable is flimsy. It got damaged after 6 months of use. Folks at the apple store refused to cover it under warrantysaying that we physically damaged the cable - I was disappointed by their answer. On a previous instant the charging adapterhas stopped working and they had replaced it no questions asked. It seems this is a recurring problem after reading a few onlineblogs/reddit forums.Also, lack of 3.5mm port is frustrating especially as the earpods were not given with the phone and had to be bought separately.",

UI :I love apple’s user interface.It doesn’t disappoint either2.performance: this is something which one can’t deny that apple phones are beast when it comes to performance. I am a heavy user and I always have 15-20 apps running simultaneously and the phone never hung.3.Improved battery life:The battery life is a huge improvement from iphone 6s.4.Dual speakers make the sound much clear5.camera:it has a 7 mp front camera and 12 mp rare . The quality is crystal clear and this feature for an apple product never disappoints as well6.weight: its light weight and easily portable7. After the update to ios 11 ,the user experience is much better and many new features have been added with the updateCons:1.Battery life should have been better.though i have mentioned it as an improvement over iphone 6s ,still i feel that with this price range the battery life should have been better2.Facing lag while playing high end games while connected to the wifi.though it may be the issue with my wifi but somehow I couldn’t rule it out3.No headphone jack : though apple provides a converter for connecting headphone ,it may be considered as a drawback for some.Overall this product is really great and a worth buy definitely. I feel price range should be reduced and given oneplus 6 in market ,the price should come down below 40K",
3484,sagar,4 May 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using iphone 7 since last 19 months and i am very much proud of it. Giving my personal reviews about itNo any issues except some minor lags and heat isseues while charging and playing games (as its universal in all phones) Back Camera quality is good in 2018 instead of being and 2016 flagship. Front camera is acceptable.Speaker is top at its markComfortable in handGood standby time but battery drains quickly while playing gamesGood software presentationFrequent updates on security and minor bug fixesYou may require a screen protectorGood call qualityYou cant simultaneously charge the phone and use headphones as it lacks headphone jack.Accurate and fast fingerprint sensor. Lacks face unlocking system.Screen not so clearly visible in sunlight. Sometimes irritable to read fonts due to small screen.You you want an iphone in 2018 or up coming 2019 then i will suggest iphone 7 as it is value for money and has same ie. exactly same functions as of iphone 8 except for wireless charging and AI which are gimmick.Matte black rocks.,

3495,Ravi Teja,8 October 2016,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't understand how few people out here have ended up getting defective pieces. I purchased this phone 3 weeks ago and had been using an iPhone 5s until then and I must say, the delivered product is absolutely legit and genuine. For the sake of my satisfaction I verified it on Apple's website by putting in my iPhone's IMEI number so there's no doubt about the authenticity of the product these people are selling down here.Now mentioning my experience with this phone so far:1) The quality of the iPhone I received is absolutely stunning and the performance is incredibly fast and fluid. I must say that this phone is a beast in terms of performance. In fact you wouldn't even notice any significant performance difference between an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 8 when it comes to day to day tasks.2) The camera is top notch and helps you shoot DSLR level videos and click some crystal clear and crisp photos on this 4.7 inch device. Front facing camera is incredible and the Touch ID sensor is blazing fast in recognising your fingerprint.3) The dual stereo speakers on this iPhone give you a very rich and dynamic music experience. This is coming from an active earphone user.4) I'll say that the display on this iPhone isn't the best when you compare it to the latest Android phones but it's certainly not disappointing at all.5) Battery life I feel is decent and can get you through a day easily if you aren't a very intense user.",

3500,Bhaskar T.,28 April 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using iphone 5s, then 6 and now 7. I must say that I'm impressed with the fingerprint, camera quality, and ofc a little with the battery life. The detailed review is as follows:-Camera: Yeah so it has a good camera, (not a camera with today's trending features,) and the best colors in this price. Yes its a competition to the pixel 2 when it comes to colors, ofc pixel 2 offers more features and that's why its better.Battery: Battery is something i must say is improved but still not upto the mark like other android phones. They offer a way better battery and at this price we expect apple to put in some effort to improve the battery life. *7-8 hours with internet on. *2 hours continuous gaming. *12 hours fine/low usage.Performance: Iphone gives you performance like no other phone. Best in performance is what iphones provide. HD display in gaming. Pubg runs smooth as butter and colors are lovely.Fingerprint: It gives a good fingerprint experience. But no face unlocking.",

Below are some features and brief description about it.BRIEF DESCRIPTION:-For all the iPhone lovers, Apple brings you the best yet. The iPhone 7 improvises on the best features of the previous generations of Apple phones. Be it the camera, the battery or the speakers, the iPhone 7 aces the game. Experience a power packed performance with the iPhone 7. Sporting a stylish compact body, the iPhone 7 is splash proof and water resistant. From a brilliant display to overwhelming sound quality, name it and the iPhone 7 has it all.Strong Water Resistant BodyNow, you can make the most of your pool parties and your outdoor games. Apple engineers have designed the iPhone 7 in such a way that it is water resistant, splash proof and dust proof. So, whether it is raining or you are at a beach, let nothing come in between your photo sessions and fun times.Feel the 3D TouchThe sensitive touchscreen of the iPhone 7 also allows you 3D touch. Also, the new Retina HD display incorporates the 3D touch facility across the iOS. Be it the music, messages or your calendar app, connect with all that in a more responsive manner with the 3D touch. See how the 3D feature works on the screen and feel the difference. The iPhone 7 also includes a home button which is a one-touch button to reach the home screen. This button is designed to be more pressure sensitive and is super responsive. In sync with the taptic engine, the home button responses precisely and is durable for prolonged use.OIS for Better Image QualityIf you love capturing all your special moments, the iPhone 7 cameras will be a delight for you to use. The optical image stabilization technology ensures that your images are free from distortion. Even if your hand shakes while clicking photos or if the subject is in movement, the image stabilization feature makes sure that your photos are crisp and clear. The sensor counters the tiniest of movement and allows up to 3x times longer exposure. The iPhone camera is powered by the image signal processor which makes your photos look perfect despite poor lightening and sudden movements. The image signal processor is built into the a10 fusion chip and powers over 100 billion operations to make your photos and videos look amazing. It also enhances the white balance in the photos and helps the auto focus.Now, even Facetiming is more fun with the iPhone 7.

Watch your photos, games and videos come alive on this screen. The colour space employed by the iPhone 7 screen is the same as that of the digital cinema industry, so you can expect a brilliant true-to-life display.All Good Things Come in Small SizesThe A10 fusion chip is the smartest and most powerful chip ever used by a Smartphone. Let not the size fool you. It not just makes the iPhone work faster, but also ensures that the functions are well executed. The processing speed is higher than the previous iPhones and does not even require much power. The battery life is the longest that you have experienced in an iPhone, and you will require less of it every day as the phone has its own mechanism of preserving power.Music to the EarsJust when you thought the iPhone 7 can’t get any better, Apple brings you the advanced stereo speakers. Producing twice as much the audio output of the iPhone 6, the stereo speakers of iPhone 7 delivers a deep and dynamic music range. So, tune in and rediscover your music.Features & details:-12MP primary camera with optical image stabilisation, Quad-LED True Tone flash and Live Photos, 4K video recording at 30 fps and slow-motion video recording in 1080p at 120 fps, 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera with Retina Flash4.7-inch (diagonal) Retina HD 3D Touch capacitive touchscreen display and home button with 1334x750 resolution and wide colour, Splash, water and dust resistantiOS 10 and iCloud operating system with A10 Fusion chip with integrated M10 motion coprocessor, 256GB internal memory and single Nano-SIMNon-removable Li-Ion 1960 mAh battery (7.45 Wh) providing talktime up to 14 hours on 3G network1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months on in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchaseSo if this review helped you please vote it helped.",

3525,Rk Kumar ,8 December 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Made a wrong choice buying a BALCK 7 from Paytm. The phone was a defective piece and they harassed a lot for return. Bought from Amazon Silver and I am glad I made the right choice. The deliver was fast, customer care was helpful for delivery, and delivery too was promt. Now to the phone- Awesome phone, very fast in functioning,  love the sleek style of it. On the  whole the experience of buying from Amazon and the phone both were satisfactory. Go for it. No one can beat the IPhone quality and the ""SWAG"" of it. yes u will hear that u will get a  bunch of phones with more specs, but a ""IPhone is a IPhone"", the experience of carrying it will be a great fun and sure will be on a different level.",

3547,SUBHASHIS BHATTACHARYYA,29 October 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  ● There are the different iPhones currently sold in India as on Jul-17- iPhone SE- iPhone 6s- iPhone 6s Plus- iPhone 7- iPhone 7 Plus● There is no point in writing in length about these phones since everyone is very well aware on the reasons why they may shop for an iphone. So, I thought it make sense to compare the prominet features that could help you to make your decision easier** iPhone SE **● This is a 4 inch phone that fits very comfortably into your hands and is good for your wallet since the 16GB version costs around Rs.21,000● This packs the same A9 processor, camera, fingerprint sensor and many other features of iPhone 6S and 6s Plus● The 12mpx camera is one of the best among phones around Rs.20,000. It supports 4K videos, live photos, full HD slow motion video, etc.● In terms of performance also, the phone stands among the top in the list in the Rs.25,000 bracket● If you dont like big screen phones, this is the best phone for you. But I would say if you have used a bigger screen phone, you would definitely struggle with this one since reading stuff on a 4 inch screen will be a real pain for you. In that case, spend this money on an Android phone and you will love it** iPhone 6s **● The main difference 6s has over SE is that 6s has got 3D Touch and display zoom other than a bigger screen of 4.7 inches3D touch is an amazing feature where the phone can understand the pressure you put on screen while touching and can activate various functions like double click, left click or many other functions that could have been achieved by more than one click● 6s also comes with a 128GB option while SE stops at 64GB● 6s has got a larger battery, but there is not much difference in battery endurance due to the bigger display● The selfie camera is also upgraded from 1.2mpx in SE to 5mpx in 6s● So, if you are on a tight budget, but still want to go for an iPhone, this one is the best choice. I bought the 32GB version for Rs.35,888 in Jun-17**iPhone 6s Plus **● The only difference 6s Plus has over 6s is the screen size which is 5.5 inch and optical image stabilisation for main camera● 6s Plus had been infamous for rumours that the phone could bend from the pressures of your pocket, but Apple is reported to have addressed it by using high-grade aluminium● Optical Image Stabilisation works can effectively eliminate effects of camera shake and images are sharper. This is especially useful during low light where the exposre is longer and there are more changes for your hand to shake or shiver during shooting● The larger screen is good for watching videos, reading, etc. And if you are a gamer, spending this much for a 5.5 inch phone makes sense. This is sold at around Rs.45,000 for the 16GB version● The phone performance and battery endurance is very much similar to iphone 6s● If you dont have a need for a larger screen, I would not recommend to spend more money, but iPhone 6s would do good for you. if you are serious on this one, I would suggest to spend a little more and go for iPhone 7** iPhone 7 **● iPhone 7 brings in a low of new features● This comes with a 4.7inch display. The display is one of the best on smartphones with a lot of new features. In practical, the display is brighter, very easy on eyes and colour reproduction is more accurate● The processor is upgraded to A10 and the camera sensor is also upgraded that excels is low light photography. The dual camera system captures depth information● There is no 3.5mm headphone plug, instead it packs the wireless earpods. However, it comes with a 3.5mm adapter that connects to the lightning port● The phone is splash as well as dust resistant● The jet black and red are the new colours iPhone 7 is sold iniPhone 7 is one of the biggest update and comes with a lot of exciting features. The 32GB version is sold at Rs.49,000. If you are serious about iPhone 7, you may need to think spending around Rs.60,000 for the black or red since the phone does not look much different from iPhone 6s if not on these colours** iPhone 7 Plus **● This is only for those people who have got deep pockets. The base version is sold at around Rs.72,000● The phone has got a bigger screen of 5.5 inch and a superior camera with optical zoom & telephoto aperture** Summary **● Go for iPhone SE only if you use your phone mainly to make calls or if you are upgrading from a smaller phone. If you are moving from a bigger screen phone, the 4 inch display of this phone will be a pain for you● iPhone 6s is the phone that I recommend if you dont want to spend too much money, but would like to boast of your iPhone among your mates● 6s Plus is not at all recommended because you will get iPhone 7 with a lot of new features if you spend a little more. However, if your only need is a larger screen I wont stop you● iPhone 7 is in a different league. Its the best iPhone available today according to me● If you are struggling to spend your hard-earned money, put it on iPhone 7 Plus black or red where you will get an amazing  gadget to show off.",

3607,Amazon Customer,15 May 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Absolute agony and mental torture...I have paid a fortune to own this piece of crap phone called iPhone, and the agonising weeks I had after the purchase was not even describable ... I bought the iPhone 7 after years of using the droids. It sure is smooth and fast and all the BS Apple fans boast about, then that is it. I had a list of things going against using the crap which includes:1.) The back camera (main camera) of the phone stopped working in just 2 weeks. No, I didn't dropped it anywhere, and it was protected with a cover every time. I have submitted my phone to the Apple care in Bangalore, and they said it would take them 3 weeks to check what the problem is and if a replacement can be made (of course my phone is under warranty!). On searching the Internet, the main camera blackout issue was a common problem in iPhone 7. Wow!!!2.) The space in the phone was never enough. Even though it has 32 GB, it got filled up in a jiffy. I backed up my videos and photos in the cloud, and still it gets filled up too soon.3.) The App and System updates were a pain  - each iOS update is no less than 1 GB to download and so is the Apps from the App store. Common apps like Whatsapp and Evernote runs in hundreds of MBs each time there's an update. My Internet data ends up updating them like in a week max.4.) Simple operations like downloading a song directly from Internet WAS NOT POSSIBLE - Even with a browser like Chrome. I then came to know that iOS prohibits downloading anything from Internet in their iPhones. To transfer files, you have to connect the phone to your system, open up the utter nonsensical iTunes and transfer the files.5.) Even though I knew there's no 3.5 mm headphone jack to it, It really was a pain when I started using it. I either can charge it or listen to the music, but not both. Why Apple why?6.) The accessories are too costly. I wanted the wireless  earpods which comes with the iPhone versions after 7, and look at its price.... I am never gonna pay that for a wireless earpod. If I have that much money, why shouldn't I go for a premium wireless headphone like the Bose?7.) The battery died off too soon. My phone was not even keeping its charge for more than 10 hours a day!I don't know on what plans I had purchased this phone. I am definitely going back to the droids.",

Eg headphones , otg cables, car audio connection cables etc. With out paying apple a percentage of the commission apple won't allow to make accessories for its lightning port. We can't use any  normal headphone or electronics in this stupid iPhone. All accessories cost 4 times its normal cost. So you have to suffer. A accessory manufacturing company paid a fine of more than 1 crore for manufacturing products for the lightning port without permission. So beware only less accessories will be there.",

3767,Oliviya Sunny Kurisingal,6 July 2017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is nice in the things it claims to be nice in..Like the camera is very good. Takes amazing pictures in day as well as low lighting situations.The speakers are the best I've heard on a smartphone, I had the Htc m9+ and these are better than those speakers..it has a beautiful screen. It's small n light weight..But this version of iPhone has the most bugs ever I think..it's wifi drops signal every few minutes. It just won't recognise your network. It'll show your network in other networks but won't connect to it.! Now the primary reason why we buy phones these days 'smartphones' not just any phones is for internet n connection.. if one can't do that than what's the point of spending so much.Even mobile signal drops randomly.It does lag in some animations. And some apps are not properly optimised so it lags in those apps.The thing now is I asked amazon for a replacement for this piece since it had several connections issues but Amazon now wants a receipt from Apple, a job sheet to replace the phone. I have to travel so far to an Apple Store now to get this thing done. Not like the Amazon I knew before.Also the delivery by amazon was so slow, it took almost a week after the product was dispatched to reach me.All I would say is the phone is nice, but when you look at it, it's not worth the 49k after hdfc cash back also forget 60k.. It loooks and performs average. No longer can we say it's Apple, it just works. There are no problems in Apple in whatever limited freedom we get to customise it.. It's just like android now.. Same problems.. N I think even more than android when am paying so much for it..",

3795,Sai,2 August 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after using the iPhone 7 for about a week, here are the things that I liked, disliked and thought are worth to mention.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHATS IN THE BOX-==================1. THE IPHONE 7 ITSELF2. THE LIGHTNING EARPODS3. LIGHTNING TO 3.5 MM JACK CONVERTOR4. LIGHTNING TO USB CABLE5. POWER ADAPTER6. SIM EJECTOR PIN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE DESIGN-=============So the new iPhone 7 black variant has a nice aluminum body with matte finish. the iPhone 7 is also now waterproof with IP67 rating. the 12mp rear camera with the led flash are present on the back, the power button with the I'm tray are present on the right side, the volume rockers and the profile button are located on the left side, on the front we have the 7mp f2.2 camera, ear piece, sensors and the 4.7 inch 1334x750-pixel resolution at 326 ppi display and the home button are present, now the home button is not really a button, it has what apple calls the taptic engine which gives a haptic feedback and simulated a real button, but doesn't really feels like a button, you can select the type of haptic feedback you like form three options. the home button also has the fingerprint scanner or touch id, its a nice quick and accurate scanner. the 4.7 inch display great too. with great viewing angles, vibrancy, and color reproduction. the colors looks natural and with nice saturation and contrast. expected nothing less from apple on this. now the biggest down side of this phone is the removal of the headphone, apple says that the lightning connector works great as an audio source for headphones, but I still miss my the 3.5mm jack, apple did provide a small lightning to 3.5mm adapter which is something you also need to carry around if you want to listen from your normal headphones or you have to switch to Bluetooth audio.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CAMERA-=============the camera has a good improvement from the iPhone 6s, it doesn't have dual cameras like the iPhone 7 plus, but it performs great. the are very detailed with great color reproduction, contrast level. the images are vibrant with good amount of saturation and sharpness. the 12mp camera now also have optical image stabilization so the video are nice and stabilized as the iPhone 6s it also shoots in 4k, the front facing 7mp camera has been improved a lot, its has nice wide frame and the image quality is also very natural, the video quality of the front facing camera is also nice you have to be careful with lighting or otherwise the contrast levels sometimes gets messed up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE PERFORMENCE-======================the iPhone 7 has the apple A10 fusion chips with six core graphics and 2gb of ram, the new processor performs great, it easily handles heavy usage and gaming, multitasking is also very fluid, it easily handles tons of app running in the background simultaneously with just 2gb of ram. the iPhone 7 comes with the new iOS 10 which has great features like the new version of siri and improved 3d touch. if you are a moderate user it will work flawlessly for you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE BATTERY-================the iPhone 7 only have a 1960 mah battery, but don't let that small size fool you it easily lasts a day even under heavy usage you can easily get it to work till night. another down side of this phone is that it doesn't support fast charging, it takes around 2 hours to fully charge from 10% to 100%. but you can also use an ipad charger to make the charging speed a little bit faster.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PROS AND CONS--THE PROS-==========1. GREAT BUILD QUALITY2. WATERPROOF3. GREAT CAMERA4. GREAT DISPLAY5. FINGERPRINT SCANNER6. GREAT FOR GAMING7. GREAT FOR MULTITASKING8. STEREO SPEAKERS-THE CONS-============1. NO HEADPHONE JACK2. NO FAST CHARGING-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL VERDICT- The iPhone is a great flagship smartphone with great specs, performance and camera, it might not be that much worth to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s but if you want the better camera, waterproofing you can definitely go for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[...]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THANK YOU",

There ain't a physical button here in iphone 7 so be careful. The cameras are upgraded and the matte black shade is amazing. But if you are a girl and you've bought the black one, you might regret at first (trust me i wanted the rose gold one). Overal its a great phone. But do mind one thing, this phone is hella slippery!

3874,Sneha Gautam,8 October 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Build and Design: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen’t make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years.The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it.The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there’s a catch. The circular button isn’t a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine’s feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn’t there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are.The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn’t much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body.The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back.There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant.Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months.Features: 8.5/10Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display.There are three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage.It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio.The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple’s history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker.On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom.Display: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch.Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren’t unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level.The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display.Software: 8/10Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap.iOS 10 dosen’t look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don’t need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store.The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched.Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures –  creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn’t on Apple devices.Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base – torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There’s also the ‘Raise to Wake up’ feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk.Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the ‘For You’ section and more.The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features.Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game – first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction.Even asking Siri simple questions such as “what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India” or “when was Siri released?” the responses weren’t very forth coming. Also between the two I also realised that most of the times you have to ask Siri questions in a particular way, and you cannot ask follow up questions and get satisfactory responses as you do with Assistant. Apple says Siri is a self-learning system, so maybe it needs more usage. But after using it for a week, it isn’t significantly better than Google Assistant. One thing I would grant Siri is the way it presents card information – is much more richer and informative than Google.Performance: 9/10Call quality is top notch with audible earpiece speaker even in high traffic situations. The iPhone 7 Plus supports Cat 9 LTE, voice over LTE, Wi-fi calling. I did not find any connectivity issues with a Jio SIM card on it, and was able to make successful VoLTE calls.With the latest Apple A10 Fusion chipset paired with 3GB of RAM (the highest seen on an Apple iPhone) you get a wicked fast device. The A10 Fusion chipset houses a quad-core processor, with two high power cores clocked at 2.23GHz and two low power saving ones. There’s a six-core GPU as well. The single core performance score of 3445 observed on GeekBench 4 was the highest we have seen on any smartphone we have tested so far. Even the multi-core score is only second to Huawei P9. The AnTuTu benchmark gives 186093 – again the highest score.In terms of raw numbers, the iPhone 7 Plus comes out tops. In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer.Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience. The speakers are quite loud, but in certain applications such as YouTube, we observed that using the headphones was a battery option.Camera: 8.5/10One of the highlight feature of the iPhone 7 Plus is the presence of the dual rear camera setup. Sure, this isn’t the first time we are seeing a dual camera on a smartphone. Huawei and LG have done this before. But just like all things Apple, the implementation is different. There are two 12MP sensors, one is standard camera which has an equivalent focal length of 28mm (with an f/1.8 aperture) and the other sensor has a telephoto lens having a 56mm focal length (with an f/2.8 aperture). The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos.While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn’t enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple’s image processor takes this decision on the fly.The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation.Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers. Colours come out natural and at times it may look a bit too dull when compared with images coming out of say a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the latest Google Pixel XL. Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much, as is seen in the fur of the labrador in the image below, around the right paw.Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode.Focussing is relatively quick. But time to first shot is still slow as compared to the quicker ways in which you can turn on cameras in some Android phones. Double tapping the home button to launch the camera is really a no brainer which Apple should implement.Low light image quality is good, but in a side by side comparison with the Google Pixel XL, I noticed that the Pixel XL clearly took the lead there. I’m not saying iPhone 7 Plus is a bad camera in low light – far from it. But the noise control, detail retention, dynamic range seen on the Galaxy S7 and Pixel XL is notches above the iPhone 7 Plus.The Portrait mode was one area which Apple spoke about a lot during the launch. During the time of testing it was only available on the beta, though it is now available to everyone. Once you turn on the Portrait mode, you will get instructions below the rounded square frame, whether you need to move closer or farther. Once you get the lock, the focussing frame becomes yellow and you fire the shutter. Images clicked in the portrait mode turned out good, it works specially well when you are in a well lit area and there is respectable distance between the subject and the background. The blurring of the background is nicely done and isn’t as aggressive as what we have seen with other dual camera phones. The good thing is that you can see the shallow depth of field while you are composing the shot. But the problem is that it will take some practise to get the shot faster. Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult.On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones.Battery Life: 8/10Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn’t a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery.Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour’s time, Apple’s charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it’s about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard. Is it holding that out for the 10th anniversary edition?Verdict and Price in IndiaAll things considered, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is a great device. It excels in departments such as battery life, performance, display among other things. The iOS 10 also brings a lot of new features to the table. The implementation of the dual rear camera is quite intelligent. Also portrait mode will be quite loved by those who love that kind of photography – it will just require patience though. While the camera image quality is good, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus still leaves scope for improvement in the low light photography department as we observed in out Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus shootout.If you are on the iPhone 6/6 Plus and are looking for an upgrade, the iPhone 7/7 Plus could be considered. For the 6s / 6s Plus users, there is little to no reason for upgrade. You would rather wait out this iteration for the 10th year iPhone edition.While the iPhone 7 Plus is good, it looks like Apple is leaving the better things for its 10th year edition. Things such as similar design, no quick charging support, similar camera app (which still makes you dig into the General settings to make tweaks in resolution and the like) among other areas have been carried forward from previous two generations. There’s a high possibility that some of these issues would hopefully be addressed in the next gen iPhone.Prices start from Rs 72,000 for 32GB, Rs 82,000 for 128GB and Rs 92,000 for the 256GB variant of the iPhone 7 Plus. The prices are high, and yes you can get a lot more in that amount. But if you want to invest in an iPhone, this is what you have to pay. A lot of telcos are offering the iPhone 7/7 Plus with various data packs as compared to Android competition. Thankfully, the pricing is in line with what it was last year. If 5.5-inch is too large a size for you, then opt for the iPhone 7 which still retains most of the internal features seen on the iPhone 7 Plus.If you are still not convinced about the iPhone 7 Plus, or are short on budget, the Android flagships that you can consider include the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge which is still a powerful device. I have been testing the Google Pixel XL for some days now, and it has already shown its capability in the low light department as compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. So that could also be a possible contender.",

The Jet Black iPhone is the first I've used caseless in years, and it's a little bit exhilarating. Thanks to the stickier finish, I haven't dropped it yet (though I suppose there's still time, knock on wood), and it feels a million times better in my hand than the iPhone 6s Plus.Also, the secret unsung hero of the new-old design: water resistance. I ended up accidentally walking into a torrential rainstorm over the weekend with my iPhone in hand, and initially let out an expletive — followed by the realization that I didn't have to worry about my electronics shorting.

Phone storage becomes an issue. You even cant think of transferring through 2 itunes eg: in work area you have laptop and home is another- it wont sync , it will only accpet one itunes - for the other one you need to replace the data & sync again.

I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones.-the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button.

   Very little new changes has been added to it compared to the iPhone 6 series. The iPhone 7 is water proof and the battery capacity has been increased to 1960 mAh from 1715 mAh in iPhone 6S, which gives improved charging capability of up to 2 hours. The display remain the same with Apple’s old IPS LCD Technology since it’s  not a AMOLED screen yet so ghosting can still be issues while running some fast animations. Camera of iPhone 7 has been bumped up to 12 megapixel of primary camera and 7 megapixel of secondary camera for selfies. Also the audio jack of the both 7 and 7 Plus has been removed and only lightning port connection is there. However if you opt for apple's own air pods then it gives much better audio experience than the iPhone 6 itself because it is wireless and communicate seamlessly with Apple’s Virtual Assistant Siri for audio control. Air pods also comes in its charging case with also enables it to pair with Bluetooth devices. The thickness and other dimensions of the phone are same as that of previous 6S but now it feels more comfortable in hands. The Home button has also changed to solid state button which gives quiet good surficial control. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus comes in limited color that is Jet Black, Silver and Rose Gold.Some of the pros and cons of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are as follows.Pros of the Device is• It has water proof body That the previous iPhone version didn’t had• Enhanced Camera Megapixels with Optical Image Stabilization. For Better Quality Photos and Videos• Increased Battery Capacity. That enables to charge battery faster and also use for longer time.Now Cons of iPhone 7 is• No microSD slot is provided for memory expansion• Its own USB Connector is present.That is lightning cable is used for both charging and audio• Primary Camera is slightly bulged out.Giving a slightly more project at camera than previous 6S So keeping all this mind iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is certainly the premium end smartphones for this price and as it always had been. But the price is not that much high and in fact same as that of iPhone 6S and there are new innovative changes also added. So iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is definitely the smartphones to go for and existing iPhone users can also upgrade their smartphones as new iPhone 7 is offering new end features with very little extra cost.To watch the review video of this product visit my profile page, check the from the YouTube channel link and enter the product name in the channel page search icon to get the product review video.",

But for this price of Rs 25000 you can't go wrong as there are a bunch of features that Apple gives you that shall make you appreciate this phone. Lets talk of them one by one.a) Build Quality - Clean, timeless, good looking, stable to holdb) Screen - Good resolution for most apps and videos.c) iOS - Functions smoothly. You will however see a hit in the battery.d) Battery - Though its not as good as the bigger phones, expect 4 hours screen on time on average with good standby time.Overall - when the iPhone 7 came out it cost about 60,000 in the market so a few years later you are getting a phone that used to be of that value in just 25,000...this is a good primary phone and a great secondary phone. If this is your first apple, please get it!touchid is reliable, cameras are clean and sharp, excellent support with existing macbook users and good multimedia experience makes this a safe, reliable, not expensive bet.",

You will never outdated for at least couple of years.There is Generally two category of people those who like phone and other one is who like Iphone.This is one of flagship phone by Apple. It was launched in Last Year September and still one of the greatest phone every made by Apple.It is not like I am praising Apple here. But here I am talking about commitment of Apple towards its Customer. Apple is the one the customer who set trends for other companies. For eg. TouchId was introduced by Apple and other phone follows the same. Later on it introduced dual camera mechanism and now a days even range phones having dual camera setup.I am waiting for Iphone 8 and let see now this time what Apple will do.

3934,Amazon Customer,18 June 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  NOTE:  This review is addressed to that class of people for whom Rs.60000-70000 smartphone is once in five years thing.Before you judge the rating which I have given and draw conclusions, I just want to let people who read this review realize that I am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as I never use a smartphone beyond 12 months.  In this process, I literally used every high-end smartphone that was launched after iPhone 3G (my first hold of a smartphone), be it xperia, blackberry, samsung, nexus, HTC, what not!Now, coming to the point of fake ratings.  I am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iPhone 7 on Amazon.  KINDLY SEE FLIPKART, without the product even launched on their site, there are 864 ratings and as much as 4.9 stars out of 5 and not a single review (I am enclosing a pic for your reference).  So, there is something which doesn't catch our eye.  But these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition, it applies to either side.ABOUT APPLEUndoubtedly, I give huge credit to Apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty Blackberry.  Like Thomas Edison, credit goes to Apple for inventing such a masterpiece.  But we are still not using the same bulb which Edison has invented.  There are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year.  Apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iPhone to keep the customer base solid.  There is so much hype created over every Apple launch and in the process, the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of Apple.  So, they clearly have the margin.  But, they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation.  This year iPhone 7 is one that's a perfect example.COMING TO THE PHONEWatched the launch event so closely, like I always do every year.  I was using an iPhone 6 and was waiting for 7 (I have had an occasion to handle and experience both iPhone 7 and 7 plus even before they were launched in India).  And finally ended up with Galaxy S7 Edge for a reason (BEFORE COMMENTING, RE-READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF MY REVIEW).  I opted for S7 Edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iPhone  The dual camera on iPhone 7 plus is not new to the world before its launch.  Secondly, they have their eyes set for the 10th Annniversary of iPhone in 2017 and are holding their cards till then.  Both iOS and Android have their own pros and cons.  This is the area which I am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone.This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks, unlike me, who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt.  Honestly, as most of the Apple users agree, what matters is the design of the phone.  If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6, a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand).  So, if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years, I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle.  And with Rs.20000 cheaper.  I put my chips in there.  Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games, it's not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.lI would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iPhone 7.  Join the line in which I am standing for the ""revolutionary"" design of an iPhone 8 in 2017.  Because, that's when Apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation.All the best!",

3936,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's good but sometimes some phone calls are missing......,
3937,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sure, Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone7 Plus are amazing. They're fast. They have cool new cameras. They're available in a sleek jet black finish. And they're even water-resistant, so you can play Pokémon GO in the rain. But they're not perfect, so before you shell out $650 or more for a new phone, be sure to consider some of the things that aren't quite perfect about Apple's latest models.1) No headphone jack. We knew this was coming, but it still comes as something of a shock. The venerable headphone jack is gone. Apple is including both a set of earbuds that work with the iPhone 7's Lightning port, as well as a dongle that will let you connect your existing headphones to the phone, but the company really wants you to switch to wireless headphones, something that was emphasized repeatedly in the iPhone 7 launch event (and if you want to charge your phone while also wearing headphones, that's your only option). Which leads us to...2) AirPods aren't included. Apple's new wireless earbuds do look awesome. They'll work with Siri. And the Apple Watch. And automatically pair with all of your Apple devices over iCloud. But they're $159, and won't be available until late October. So, be sure not to lose that dongle before then.3) Dual-lens camera is only available in 7+. Apple boasts that the new dual-lens camera is the best on the market, and with a real zoom lens and the ability to do all sorts of slick depth-of-field tricks, it may indeed smoke all other smartphone cameras. Too bad it's only available in the iPhone 7+. If you opt for the smaller, less expensive iPhone 7, you still get a camera that beats the one in the iPhone 6, thanks to a better lens and image stabilization,  but it's not the best on the market, is it?4) It's going to get all scratched up. Cult of Mac points out that Apple has warned that that new, cool jet black paint job is more susceptible to ""fine micro-abrasions"" than other colors. Not that it really matters, since...5) You'll need to buy a new case. Sure, despite a new color, the iPhone 7 looks almost identical to the 6/6s models it replaces. But looks can be deceiving. While the dimensions of the iPhone 7 are indeed nearly identical to those of last year's models, its new cameras mean that the camera cutout on many older cases won't fit right. And instead of a headphone cutout at the bottom, you'll need a case with dual speaker cutouts for the iPhone 7's new stereo speakers. Bottom line: Be prepared to spluge on a new case to go with your new phone.6) It's not waterproof. You may see references to the iPhone 7 being waterproof, but it's not. Apple refers to it as being ""splash, water and dust resistant,"" and warns that its resistance level could ""decrease as a result of normal wear."" The company also warns that the phone's warranty doesn't cover liquid damage, so you may want to avoid any temptation to take your new iPhone into the shower with you.7) It's an iPhone. If you're a fan, that's great. But if you're one of the millions of Android owners out there (and globally, Android's market share is much bigger than that of Apple's iOS), it was just another opportunity to point out how much better your favorite platform is (not that Android phones don't have their share of problems).",

3945,Amazon Customer,10 November 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  at this date iphone 7 32gb is available for 50k. i believe that this could be the best price to buy this phone; but is it worth spending 50k? within a month from now samsung s8 is going to be in market, according to the promotion videos and leaks s8 is going to be the best and most beautiful phone ever. surely s8 will be the best looking phone with a lot of features nd other cool stuffs which other brands don't offer. but then people will judge me based on an os platform, its ios or its apple nd all. i would like you to be aware that apple is also going to make huge changes this year as their 10th anniversary and according to leaks and rumors all over the Internet it will somewhat look like Samsung s8 with edge display. you can check on youtube for visual ideas. my recommendation is that keep your hard earned money 50k for upcoming releases, if u are apple fan then u can go for iphone edition or if u wouldn't mind going to android then s8 is going to be the best phone this year. for me 50k is a huge amount of money, if 50k is just your pocket money and u think you can save another 50k till sept. then only u can think of buying iphone7. Because after the release of new iphone edition (or iphone 8 whatever apple is going to name it) iphone 7 is going to loose its value to very much extent. if u will go to sell 7 32gb then the chances arw u wont get more than 30k, and next iphone is surely be going to start at a price of 70-80k. so think wisely and analyse your needs and spend your money. 50k is not earned with a blink of eye.",

Another IPhone 7 purchased few months ago charges perfectly in 2-3 hours.Amazon Support: The 7 Day Return/Replacement promise is a sham. Amazon doesn’t take any ownership and simply passes the buck option to Apple for redressal who in turn ask you to visit an authorised service centre where they will check to see if replacement can be done. For return Apple sends you back to Amazon. There is no option on Amazon to submit a complaint for refund. It’s a Catch 22 situation for me.,

Secondly iOS doesn’t provide freedom as Android. The most annoying issue with iOS is Very limited compatibility with true caller. I get 20-30 calls a day and most of those are SPAMS. In iPhone i can not identify those as there is no caller id.

3965,Praphul Nambiar,10 April 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  At the reduced price points during the sale with cashback and instant discounts on offer, this phone is a no brainer to go for. Considering Apple's rather silly pricing of the 8/8+/X/XS/XR the iPhone 7 is still a very capable phone. Best part is the new home button (no more hardware failures) and with the latest versions of iOS it still remains fast and responsive.People will have to get used to the lack of a headphone jack but if paired with a good quality wireless headset, it is a non issue. Battery life does well too.Amazon's exchange process is easy and trouble free.",
3966,Ved Prakash,11 October 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  iPhone is a great device, because of the tight integration of hardware and software. This is my second iPhone and I have purchased it on 2018 (2 yrs after release) because I think 40,000 is max I am willing to spend on this device.Ok, so I like Android too, I'm a owner of Nexus 6P too, so I know what pure Android feels like, but because security is better on iOS, I use iOS too.I'm writing this review after 5 days of use. Battery life is good. Specially on standby. Screen size is on sweet spot. 4.7 inch doesn't feel too small, not too large. (I prefer my 6P to consume multimedia content).Stereo speakers are good. Bass is great, and they are clear. Sound that come from this device is really good.32GB internal storage definitely going to feel less in some time but as I said I'm not going to use this for multimedia consumption, so I think it's ok.Camera is good. Low light is not as great as I'm used to be on my Google device, but still on proper lighting, it's better than 6P.Build quality is excellent. It's feel like a premium piece of metal. And this matte Black finish looks really cool. It's feel like I'm holding a Batman's phone or something.Features on iOS 12.1 are good too. Device is smooth and fast. Getting 60fps animations throughout the UI.I love both OS, so I like to carry both Android and iOS device.All an all, this is a great phone with fast SoC (A10 fusion) and well optimised hardware with software. If you will be able to buy it under 35000, you're making a correct decision. This device deserve 40K (currently) without any question.Hope this review will be helpful to you.",

4223,Riddhi,24 September 2017,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its unfortunate that item received within a week turned out to be defective where other party ""simply cant"" hear my voice. It seems to be working fine only with earphone. Resetting the phone by wiping out the data did not help. Issue seems to be consistent across multiple service providers SIM.Now its with apple service center for further diagnostics.Even if you buy an expensive phone, its not guaranteed to work  and to have piece of mind. This is how they manufacture defective product and make money.",
4224,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using it for a week, loving it so far. I usually stretch any phone's performance by playing heavy duty games, installing lots of apps and frequently app switching. The phone is keeping up well so far. After switching from android, it takes some time to get used to it. But the phone's performance and camera quality are superb. Battery life lasts longer than my nexus 5x. I was sceptical about the 2GB ram but it hasn't disappointed me so far. Pretty happy about it!",
4225,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  First, I was very much skeptical to order an iPhone over the internet, be is amazon or flipkart, I still feel its the luck factor when you still get your costly devices in hand one piece as they should be; given the terrified instances we have seen with many retailers. I understand there's little control over these things, even from amazon's perspective (which they are doing a splendid job), I feel the onus completely lies on the retailer.Alright, so the core part of this......Amazing, superb, splendid, awesome, classic...I feel short on adjectives to define this masterpiece...Apple,,,I have started to fall in love with Apple devices. I have resisted them over the years, but now I realize I have 3 of them....you can choose to ignore but can't resist.A simple, yet powerful device, makes your life hell lot easy...powered packed components. One thing which I admire about this is that they dont need jazzy advertisements or fake ratings to promote apple devices, they are build the way you wouldn't hate them. Although the ram seems to be less, the memory management is so efficient that you dont have to bother on clearing the cache (unlike android).Display is superb, crystal clear...just make sure you get a tempered glass, and it adds an additional beauty to this. i still wonder when you made such an excellent device, why cant apple build the glass that way.So far I feel 32 GB is enough although I have started taking more pictures...you'll feel the need to do it given the camera quality. They should have given an option for potrait mode (with some additional price ofcourse). This is for someone who dont want a large screen but needs a dual camera and potrait mode. Still I am pretty much happy with the picture quality and the composition.I like the touch button and the level of customization available.overall, not regretting the decision at all...happy about it....I think I made the right choice.",
4226,Sandhya Aggarwal,30 May 2017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Apple iPhone 7 (Black) is a step ahead from the previous iPhones. I previously used the iPhone 6 and this one has a lot many new features like 3D Touch, Force Touch, Live Photos and the phone is a lot more faster too. The new iOS works swift and fast and is very suitable for the the 7. Amazon offered a great deal on the phone during Diwali and I got it for about 37,500. Amazon delivery was straight up; the phone was seal packed and retains the apple 1 year warranty. The matte black is a great colour, relatively harder to scratch than the jet black version too. This one has a very subtle look to it; un-exagerated and un-boastful in appearance.For new iPhone users, this is a competitive price to start off with the iPhone experience. Apple makes very simplistic designs and has a clear philosophy. The phone does not allow for much customisability options but in itself is content.Great deal made the Diwali a happy one.Product Quality: 10/10Price Value: 10/10-soothsayer",
4227,Raj,7 September 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  An Iphone is an Iphone.....World's best phone.Prior to iphone i was using Xiaomi Mi5 . Specs wise Mi5 has has better specs as compared to Iphone 7 like 16 MP camera, Full HD Screen and light weight. But these specs are just for marketing gimmicks these cheap android phone manufacturer doesn't know how built a quality product.  One thing i have learned is specs doesnt always matter it's hardware and software integration that matters.1. Good Screen Quality: Even though my mi5 has full hd ips screen but iphone's screen is far better . Numbers doesn't matter.2. Camera: Iphone's 12 MP rear camera is far better than most of the android phone. Mi5 16 MP Camera does't match half the quality of iphone's.3. Processor's : Iphone's A10 Fusion processor is the fastest processor in the world.and sinc it has been designed by  apple's itself so there is better integration and use of processor in iphone. In terms of speed and responsiveness there no match for Qualcomn snapdragon SOC.4. Hardware and software integration: Since apple controls both hardware and software. Iphone 7 has 2 gb ram and there is no lag even when using 7-8 apps simultaneously. Mi5 has 3 gb ram but it still get slow and hangs many a times.5.",
4228,Kanhaiya Lal Sharma,25 December 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got this iPhone 7 black 32gb at 43k while it costs 56k at imagine store. I had read so many positive as well as negative reviews before buying it online. I was very confused whether I will be getting a fresh, seal-packed iPhone made for Indian market or something imported from abroad or something defective. I had another option to get it from gulf countries where it would cost around 44k but that wont have been accepted in Indian apple customer services for free repairing/ warranty.Finally I decided to buy it online and I don’t regret it. I got a original product and it is running smoothly w/o any issue. You can go for this seller while buying a iPhone.",
4229,Rimo,4 June 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Apple it is. Another elegantly designed master piece from Apple. Benchmark performance in all aspects... camera, sound, display, user interface, performance, touch screen, fingerprint sensor, apps, design, dimension, optimization and most importantly reliability.

4233,Arnab C,13 May 2017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Little difficult when you migrate from other OS based mobile. I have used Lumia phones for many years and then migrated to Android last year. Thanks to Redmi revolution in India. I bought 3s Prime last year but it last for only 8 months. Because of some issues, that didn’t work. Amazon big billion day started exactly at the same time. Thank god, I am able to grab 1 offer and that’s when I became an iphone user. Now, iphone 7 is on my hands. Amazing transition experience till date but struggling a bit to get used to this. Hope this lasts for a ling time like my earlier Nokia Lumia. Thanks Apple. Hope to have a bonding with you for more years ahead!",
4234,Kindle Customer,17 May 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Satisfactory move from android to iOS. Though I’m new to iOS, it didn’t trouble me much to get adjusted and used to.My personal opinion is it’s the best mobile if you are looking for a long run like 2+ years. At this time around 35k it’s the better  mobile no doubt. I haven’t seen much comparable differences between apple 7 and 8.Samsung S8 and LG G6 are on top of it,  S8 is around 55k and G6 is around same price to apple 7 but when it comes to durability and long run I doubt.",

4251,Nandish,18 May 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The iPhone 7's notable camera, battery and water resistance improvements are a worthwhile upgrades to a familiar phone design, but ask yourself if you really need an upgrade...and if the Plus might be a better choice.  GOOD SIDEs  (+)______________# Improved cameras very well,# The front with 7 MP camera is giving you really good pictures.# Even the back shooter also is a very good camera.# Beautiful design# Screen and battery life is also improved# Water resistance# Tap-tic engine feedback is neat# Powerful dual speakers# Starts at 32GB, finally# Ios 10, it actually really works well with the hardware of the phone. Every thing run smoothly, looking from gaming to test massaging or browsing the web at the same time, every thing is very smooth# Software update is always on time, this is the apple's best thing  BAD SIDEs  (-)____________# No headphone jack# Iterative design# Many of the ""groundbreaking"" features have been on Android phones for a while# Wireless audio ecosystem is immature# Jet Black model scratches easilyReasons to BUY The iPhone 7_________________________# VERY FAST.... Giving apple A10 fusion chip, which is 40% faster than previous, as well as 50% faster graphics.# FLASH DRIVE.... If you are worried about storage, then, SanDisk offering ""iXpand"" Flash drive upto 128 gb at 8500/- Rs.product link  >((  http://www.amazon.in/SanDisk-iXpand-Flash-iPhones-Computers/dp/B01F6RWV94/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499795607&sr=1-1&keywords=external%2Bdrive%2Bfor%2Biphone&th=1  ))# WATER & DUST RESISTANCE.... Now the iPhone 7 has IP67 water resistance, no need to worry about the water under 15 cm.# CAMERAS..... We have some great cameras on iPhone 7 or 7 plus. Now iPhone 7 has optical stabilization, which something we didn't having in previous iPhone, also get 1.8 aperture. And 7 MP front facing camera which will give decent photos, also 1080p video recording from front.#STEREO SPEAKERS.....  This time around we don't have 1 speaker, we have 2 speakers, one at the top and one at the bottom. they are very loud, which is really need.# COLOR... Now iPhone comes with beautiful jet black and matte black. You will fall in love with the phone. Reasons NOT To Buy The iPhone 7_____________________________# DESIGN.... Apple making almost same design from so many generation. Its nice to having something nice, some thing new. all other competitors are trying for something new.# CAMERA BUMP..... The camera bump looks ugly, If apple had make the device a little bit thicker, there would be no camera bump, and you have the space for BIGGER BATTERY, which will made big deference. It have longer life battery because of optimization of new processor.# BATTERY..... We still don't have the fast charging or wireless charging. Now wireless charging  i get not everybody use this, But fast charger we really need for this. Yes we have fast charger with iPad, but we need fast charger along the iPhone itself, which will charge faster.# HEAD PHONE JACK..... This is a too much of big a deal, Yes they are giving lightning converter, but if you listening something to your headphone wide, working on your phone, and you need to charge, that will be big issue.# MICRO SD CARD SLOT.... Specially i really miss the absence of Micro SD card slot. I think every body is. We really need micro SD slot on iPhone for more space option. But yeah this option will little bit slow down to iPhone performance.# CUSTOMIZABILITY ON IOS.... If you are a person that really like to customize your phone, then ios is definitely not for you.So that is it. Thank You.I THINK IT WILL HELP YOU.Thank you Amazon India",

4332,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  From being a hardcore android fan, I have made the move to iPhone 7.Why did I move:1. Smooth, fast os that is always on the latest versionThe os is optimised beyond belief. Its been close to a month, and the response time is ridiculous. Even with lower specs, the iPhone delivers an experience unlike any other2. Quality of appsNot one app has crashed. Each app is extremely responsive, and the change to the physical button, with 3d touch have made the customisations absolutely amazing3. SecurityIt is the most secure operating system. Period. No app can read your messages, or request to make calls on your behalf. In the long run, it is definitely a more closed environment, which works perfectly for meElephant in the room: No Jack! Well, yes. Has it impacted me - no. Why? Because i already had bluetooth headphones. And when they are discharged, I have the apple headphones provided with the phoneBattery: Gets through a day easily (with about 6 hours of screen on time). My moto x pure never gave me more than 4 hours SoT. Also, the low power mode is an absolute beastThings that took some getting used to/could help if added:1. Smart shortcuts (being able to see which wifi you are connected to via one swipe)2. Long press shortcuts to launch settings",

4343,konetiLokesh,10 December 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using apple products from past 4-5 years and I never really though of buying another android phone available this days in the market.The only problem is battery life and you can not expend the memory of this but over all it will never hang like other phones no matter how much you use and for many years.No phones are better than iphone.Totally satisfied with it.,
4344,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The iPhone 7 was launched back in 2016 and was an instant hit when it launched, similar to other iPhones. Also similar to iPhones is just how well this phone has aged. Compared to other flagships released at that time, the iPhone 7 has better performance and has even held on to it's value well. But it's 2019, and there is a ton of competition where the iPhone 7 stands. First thing's first, if you're not adamant about getting an iPhone, don't consider the iPhone 7. The OnePlus 6T is one phone which can be bought at a similar price point and is better in almost every way.If you have to buy an iPhone at this price point, the iPhone 7 is still a solid device. It has-1. Decent display2. Decent performance3. Will still get software updates for the next 2 years.4. Good resale value5. Good bragging value6. Compact size7. A more secure software experience8. Very good cameraAll in all, you get the benefits of the iOS eco system as a whole when you buy the iPhone 7. All the components of the phone today are what we can call great but not mind blowing. To someone looking for a compact, well rounded smartphone with 2-3 years of usable life left, I would whole heartedly recommend the iPhone 7. However, if the price was closer to the Rs 30K segment, this phone would have been absolutely killer.",
4345,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this in October 2017. I got it at an amazing price. It was last year's flagship at that time and I couldn't have been happier. I was used to phones from Xiaomi at that point so I was looking forward to exploring this. I already had a Macbook Air and this made perfect sense.2017: Love at first sightI was blown away by the performance of the device. It just works perfectly; there is no lag; the camera is just awesome and takes perfect pictures and the video quality is just amazing! The sound quality via headphones is one of the best I have heard and the dual speakers works wonders! The battery life is also decent; I was expecting very bad battery life but it is good, it last 1 and half days which is awesome for such a thin and light phone.2018: The cracks start to appearThe phone is performing perfectly. I can see using it till at least 2021. It is still a beast; I don't play many games but it does the trick; however there are some nuances:1. I got a 32 GB version of the phone which got filled really fast and iCloud only allows 5 GB so I had to upgrade. It was only Rs 75/- per month for 50 GB so its fine.2. I can't download music without iTunes and it is pretty annoying. I made my own song and cannot load it on my phone. I have 2 computers, a Macbook Air and a desktop. I can't import music from the desktop as it is locked to my MAC. My MAC is having issues of it's own which means I can't load music to my phone without losing whatever is already there. This is beyond stupid.3. I can't turn off bluetooth or wifi. Turning it off via the quick toggle disconnects it and doesn't turn it off. Why would anyone want to just disconnect without turning it off?4. The lightning cable broke. I ordered a replacement and it didn't work after a few days. Turns out you need an apple certified cable which costs over Rs 500 (at least); so that's more money down the drain.5. I bought apple music which costs Rs 120 permonth as it is easier to attach a damn cable everytime I want new music. I know I can do it wirelessly but I would prefer doing it without a computer. It is a smartphone; should it be able to just add music to my music play list?6. I don't know what Apple did but the battery life is now horrible. I bought Baseus 5000 mAH charging case and my phone feels like a brick now. Still worth it as it runs for 3 days straight!7. I can't seem to take pictures in 16:9 aspect ratio. The camera app doesn't have that option.8. Youtube just punishes apple devices; every other video I play will always have an ad. I have an android phone as well and I only get ads may be once every 5 videos.I am using the same account on both devices.9. I removed apps like Amazon, Flipkart and stuff; it just eats space and I  only have 32 GB.10. The lightning to 3.5 mm adapter got lost. :( So I had to buy another one for Rs 900! The apple wired earphones sound very bad compared to my Sennheiser 275s. Next time I will buy a phone with a headphone jack.11. I tried using a wireless earphone. Problem is everytime I have to unpair it from one of my phones to connect to the other one. Then again, I have to unpair it from my phone to connect to my Mac. My PC doesn't have bluetooth so I have to use a wired headphone there. Also battery life drains very fast when I use bluetooth on my iPhone and now I have to keep charging my bluetooth headphone which has a micro USB cable. Great!. So I am carrying a Lightning cable, a USB type C cable for my android phone, a micro USB cable, a 3.5 mm headphone, USB type C to 3.5 mm (because I did not learn the lesson the first time) and a lightning to 3.5 mm headphone. Perfect!12. I am still happy with the performance of the phone though. Still no lag, feels like new.2019: Never going back to iPhone (most likely)1. I spent around Rs 200 every month on iCloud 50 GB and apple music every month. In a year I spent over Rs 2400/- I bought the battery case for Rs 5500/- and it has stopped working because the lightning adapter in the battery case stopped working. I bought a lightning to USB cable for 625/- and another one which did not work after a few days for 150/-. Taking into account screen protectors, cases, etc. I have spend almost Rs 10,000/- on things which were not factored into the cost of the phone. I am not including the bluetooth headset because I use it generally and is not specific for the phone.2. Apple has slowed down my phone or has done something to it as it is not as snappy as it was.3. The battery life is horrible. I went trekking a took a lot of pictures and in the morning it was 100% by 12 pm it was 5% and then it powered off. Of course I did not take continuous pictures. Around 100 or so pictures, and a couple of videos (totalling about ) 15 mins of videos.4.  My earpiece has stopped working and I have to almost shove the phone down my ear and so I use speakers for calls everytime. It will cost Rs 3500/- to fix.",
4346,Shivansh sharma,22 June 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Initally, I bought 32gb iPhone6 in 2017 for 30k from Amazon India, Great phone, but now I have sold it for rs 4500 via cashify.Reason you should buy it :1. Less money2. Want to have an iPhoneReason why you should not buy it1. Ios 12 used about 20gb in iPhone 6, newer ios 13/14 shall used even more.2. Each app is around 200mb minimum, so only 10 - 20 apps and you are nearly full.3. Each photo is around 5 mb, so just imagine, you shall have no space.To overcome the space problem, you can buy icloud for 75rs/month for 50gb cloud space for photos.But you shall only get max upto ios15 update, and then like iphone 6 it shall stop getting updates.So I suggest buy new phones from Apple or go to android with samsung m series phones.

4351,karan kahar,9 June 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  he iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are deeply unusual devices. They are full of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple’s steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations.Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours.And, yes, Apple has removed the headphone jack.Removing the headphone jack is an act of pure confidence from Apple, which is the only company in tech that can set off a sea changes in the industry by aggressively dropping various technologies from its products. Floppy drives, optical drives, its own proprietary 30-pin iPod connector, flash, even USB — Apple decides that it’s time to move on, and it has a massive installed base of customers that love and trust the company who make it happen. And now it’s decided that — yikes — the headphone jack is over.After using the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for about a week, it’s clear to me that Apple has forceful, but considered opinions about how the next generation of phones should fit into our lives. But it’s also clear that the iPhone 7 is a transitional step to that vision of the future, not a complete expression of it. The question for would-be upgraders is simple.",

4356,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dear friends,Apple iPhone is undoubtedly an overrated phone with lesser features than other reputed brands available for 1/3rd price.We use the phone for maximum 1-2 years & what's the point in buying an overpriced iPhone, when other reputed brands phones with much better features are available for 70% lesser price and has the same durability like an iPhone.It's just a hype they create by releasing new model iPhone once in 8 months to manipulate & tempt the foolish people to buy the new model by wasting their money by exchanging their previous model iPhone for very less price.Foolish people are making the clever company rich without thinking about the real plans of Apple (marketing gimmick & nothing special in quality, but highly priced).Please think well before spending your hard earned money on an iPhone.... Donate the same extra money you spend, to some needy people instead of wasting it by paying to a rich company like Apple.",
4357,jaywant,29 October 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I was surprised to see there was no sealed packaging. There was a thin plastic cover over the white box and it didn’t require any cutting. I expected a sealed box inside but that wasn’t the case also. I had bought iPhone online earlier also and it required the plastic cover to be cut open.This makes me feel that I got an open box deal. Is it what I should have expected?,

4361,Surya,26 February 2021,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi everyone, after d usage f dis phone around 3 years m writing dis review. My opinion complete no for dis waste phone. Apart from show off u couldn’t do anything with it.1. Battery - Backup itself is ultra low dt u need to either plug to socket always or charge it for 2-3 times a day. At dis modern era dis phone is out f competition. Most f al when u r traveling dis battery power drops like anything, I don’t know y.2. Basic services like music , storage etc u have to pay monthly. When u can use almost all d services in android den it sucks to pay. Even u can’t set ua fav ringtone in a easy way. U can set but for dt u should follow hell lot of procedure.3. Charging n music usb are same - first f al its battery backup is so low and u can’t listen d music at dt time . What d hell .4. Overpriced- for dis small piece of shit.5. Not for professionals- couldn’t use Microsoft or some other mails.Conclusion: never go for  products , dey r just making d money by fooling d public.",
4362,Vardhan,25 October 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let no one say Apple products do not hang. It frequently does. And feels fragile.

4365,Umang,11 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  trust me before this all i ever thought of iPhone and all I have ever used was a thick piece of metal which did some of what Android phones did.....except for 6s of course.....but this redefines what a mobile is and what it should do to make u happy....it gives u as much as you want in every possible way. A Punchy display, A clever crisp audio processor, an intelligent OS which can go toe to toe  with  Android in any day, splendid fingerprint reader, awesome camera(both front and back), the size might be one the wrong end for some people but trust me, this strikes a powerful blow in any top Android phone......Samsung S8 can be the Prince of All the phones but iPhone7  with their current  customization is definitely the King...(well iPhone 7 plus is the king of Kings so no point including that)Cons include a restriction with using either a charger or music cable at one point of time, which can be easily over come by using a bluetooth headphones,the ones coming from Samsung flagships will definitely feel a little bit let down by iPhone's display in the beginning.",

4394,ASHISHKANT ,5 June 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are deeply unusual devices. They are full of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple’s steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations.Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours.And, yes, Apple has removed the headphone jack.",

But there is a 50% chance that you may need some assistance for some reason from their customer service. This is the catch.They are as bad as it gets. They talk about replacing the phone for every small reason. They have too many clauses for warranty.I went there to fix one minor issue. They took my phone and returned with two other issues and asked me to replace it by paying 28,350.I got it to work by getting it fixed by myself after realising the issue was just that the sim was getting stuck. So, I would had paid 28,350 for nothing had I listened to them.Never buy an apple product in India. It's too big of a risk despite of paying such hefty price.Regarding their customer service, don't believe me, just go to any local mobile repair shop and ask them how is it, they will laugh and tell you it's just a replacement centre not a service centre.",

4428,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have bought my iPhone 7 32GB Matte black on 8th Oct just the day after the phone has been launched in India. I have been using it since almost a month. I bought it directly from apple store. And truly i would say, its an amazing device. My reviews are below.1. Great display, its has more color gamut than its previous versions.2. Great stereo speakers, as it has 2 speakers one at the head another at the bottom.3. The antenna band is only 5% visible in bare eyes, until & unless you minutely see it. So the design at the back side looks really clean and sturdy.4. Home button is no longer a physical button now, so it gives you haptik feedback whenever you give an amount of pressure to it. So the amount of pressure you apply decides what function it would invoke.5. The iSight camera now has OIS. So no flickering even if you are shooting while running.6. The touchID is much more faster than 6s. takes a bare minimum of 9-10s to create a touchID.7. A full charge of battery on heavy usage lasts a day. But if you are a moderate user it can last even more. And surprisingly it takes only 2 hours to charge it 100%.8. The Matte finishing on the back side is much more smoother and silkier than 6s. And believe me just go for Matte black if you are planning to buy it. The jet black version is a heck of fingerprint magnet, it takes a scratch even if your nails touches the back side. If you are going for a jet black version please buy a leather back cover before you open the plastic seal of the phone.9. Apple says the phone is splash resistant, but i have seen many of the vlogs the phone is actually water resistant upto 1 metre.10. The conversion of 3.5mm jack to reversible connector has improved the music quality even more.One important thing i would say to every apple user, please buy apple products directly from apple authorized sellers or re-sellers. You can buy it from Reliance Digital, E-Zone, Apple store. Don't buy apple products from online portals, as none of them are authorized by Apple. So if anything gets damaged to your apple device Apple service center doesn't accept the product. And this has happened with many a people.",

The pressure for the feedback back can be adjusted. It has Siri built in.The phone now supports stereo speakers as well.Now let's start with the review.Pros :. The new iPhone 7 has a huge upgrade in the camera department when compared to the 6 or 6s. The output from the speakers is very good thanks to the stereo speakers. Though it supports only a 1960 mAh battery the battery life is very good and. Can give one hour more screen on time than the 6s.. It can handle any game with ease and no lag. The general performance is top notch. The processor is the best and most powerful  processor.Cons :. The worst part is the absence of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. You need to carry the dongle to use headphones or use a wireless one .. The supplied charger is very slow(5V-1A).That's all . I hope you liked the review if you did please press the helpful button.

4433,dhanasree,15 August 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Apple iPhone is 100% value for money. It is just people don't realise or they don't need those features they just buy for the logo .  I tried 25 phones in the last 3 yrs and finally settled for iPhone . So far if u want to go for performance in mid  range go for Moto  Mobiles but their camera and audio quality on earphones sucks . If u want to go for looks display and camera Samsung is best but only fault is earphone volume . If u r traveling in train or bus , the earphone volume is not enough while watching videos . Finally all these shortcoming overcome by apple . The biggest advantage of iPhone is their OS which gets update every year , its simplicity of OS , its processor which is miles ahead of any android processor like 6s which is 2 yrs old  can easily beat Galaxy s8 processor .  Few things like connecting to a bluetoth speaker most phone cant control volume of Bluetooth speaker precisely only iPhone does . The. Reason is simple its OS is same for the last 10 yrs I mean the basic functionality and it is the only company which has complete control over their OS . In android its mixture of Google and other company software like miui or Samsung software which make things messy . I know all these things doesn't matter to a normal consumer but that doesn't make iPhone a waste of money . It is always worth if u buy an iPhone . Its value doesn't decrease as rapidly as other phones .",
4434,Chethan ts,23 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Good phone,
4435,Sreeraj,8 June 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Came to this phone after selling my Google Pixel XL, which was a great phone on its own, but wanted to see what the fuss is about iOS and Apple's better app ecosystem and all that. My main comparison of this phone will remain with the Pixel.Positives first:- Top class build quality. The phone looks solid, feels solid. Finishing of the product is top notch.- Taptic Engine. Vibration motor of a phone is a hugely important thing and this phone has the best vibration I have ever experienced. No Android flagship phone I have used has anywhere near the intensity or quality. Reminds me of the olden days of them Nokia phones with huge vibration motor inside them. Great job there hands down.- Camera is good. In low light especially. Noise are kept well in control. Overall the camera can't beat Pixel, can't beat a lot of other phones anyway, but its a good camera, especially for someone who used to use DLSRs for long time to appreciate natural, less saturated output. And video quality is tremendously good.Though the front camera is awful. I almost never use it, but coming from a Pixel it felt like having a VGA front camera.- Fingerprint reader is in the best position in front, and it works every time.- Smoothness. Well smoothness is good. Definitely much less frame drops overall across the UI than Pixel, but not to an extent where it could make significant difference anyway.- RAM Management. Excellent. For a phone having 2 gigs of RAM, well I can only laugh at Android. Where Pixel reloaded apps with double RAM, this thing can apps in memory.- Battery life. Very good. For a tiny sized battery, I am getting 6-7 hours of SoT with 24 hours of standby time.- RAW Speed. Needless to say anything about the A10 chipset. It chews graphically demanding games and apps like nothing. There simply is no Android phone which can come anywhere close.Now the Negatives, which outdo the positives for my usage:- Most impractical and unintuitive OS I have ever experienced. The scrolling mechanism is stupid. You can't scroll fast up or down, it will stuck at a point, so you will get tired. And it misses some touches in the process to. Waste of time. Free flow scrolling for life.Then there is no system wide BACK option. This will drive you bonkers if you are coming from android. Every app is different, where most apps do have the gesture support of left to right to go back to previous screen, its still nowhere near as fast as simply hitting a back button. And on some apps there simply is no gesture support, like Paytm for example. And the back button is located on TOP LEFT corner, which you can't reach with one hand, and I am using the smaller version of the phone. You can touch the home button twice to activate a reduced sized display of current screen, but it goes away as soon as you do something which requires to move to another screen. Ridiculous beyond explanation.Also there is no share option to other apps like Snapseed or Drive or Google Photos directly from the native Photos app! Another time wasting thing!There is no T9 support on the native dialler. ROFL.- Call quality. I don't know but I just don't like the call quality, especially when I am coming from a phone which had brilliant call quality.- SAR value! Don't know how it could be that absurdly high! Check GSMArena specs! Scary really!- No fast charging. This simply should be here. Even this smaller battery takes full two hours to charge fully, LoL.That's it basically. When this phone works for a lot of people, who think that this phone is miles ahead in terms of whatever, probably for the fruit logo at back side, this was simply not for me. Absolutely ridiculous amount of time I wasted trying to do simple things. I never did care about the Apple logo, God knows which type of people care about that, so for me, I need something which is much more practical, much more intuitive, and which won't drive me bonkers for simple stuffs, so yeah that was Apple for me.Best of luck.Regards,Saurav",
4436,Vishwakarma P,23 April 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this product from local Apple authorised store and this is what I feel after using it for almost 15 days now.They say it has superior hardware like better processor,camera and battery life with additional features like waterproof and dust proof compared to IPhone 6s. Practically it makes no differerence at all except for camera. Any application you run in iPhone 7 and IPhone 6s takes same time and also same time to copy files etc. What is the meaning of superior hardware if it makes no difference compared to its predecessors?This hardware etc. is just selling point of this phone as its battery life is same as IPhone 6s too.If you are upgrading from iPhone 5s or 6 to Iphone 7 then it could be worth but if you are upgrading from 6s then it is completely waste of money. For IPhone 6s/plus users I say wait for Iphone 7s.",
4437,Mridu Pavan Bharadwaj,14 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great phone. The performance and looks are mind blowing. The only drawback is that it does not have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so you need to carry a usb type-C to 3.5 mm otg adapter to listen to songs on eraphones.",
4438,gaurav gupta,5 June 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought iPhone on 5th May. The Price got reduced 4000 rupees less than a week. I am Very much disappointed.,
4439,Amazon Customer,18 June 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have used a s7 edge before I bought a iPhone from local dealer,I was very impressed by audio quality in s7 and have heard Samsung put a lucky chip for audio which improved the sound wearing headfones very much better than s6.After listening to my music on iPhone 7 I found it outclassed all Samsung flagship models especially when listening  to music over iphone speakersworld,if picture colour  accuracy is what u like iPhone is the one for you",

4451,Amazon Customer,9 March 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Good,
4452,Bharath Kumar,7 March 2019,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Everything is great but the price is not what it should be. It should be around 22k at max because it is 4.5 years old iphone. Apple won't give software support after 5 years.,

4455,Hemant,20 August 2019,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:My previous I phone was 6s which I lost in the market make police complaint but still no clue.  not traceable.. No idea how to trace it.New one is I phone 7 .  I did not think about it is a good decision in buying the I phone 7 in May-2020Camera quality is little bit better than in 6sSound clarity is goodcharging little faster than 6s & Battery life is also better.Only difference is audio jack.Cons;Battery life is still an issue in I phone.No facility to expand the memory.Better to add one plastic case/cover for protection,  like the other mobile like oppo.Many apps are available in google store but not available in app store.Overall I am happy with the phone.",
